2
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:35,897
It's tulip season today,
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:42,582
Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:55,028
Yes, come on now, sweetheart.

5
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,235
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

6
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,200
Go for a ride.

7
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,872
Come on, sweetie.

8
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:13,577
Freeze!
Leg down, leg down.

9
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,585
That's it.
Come on now.

10
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,092
No, you monkey-eared
son of a bitch!

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,098
You have pissed your last floor.

12
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:32,208
Bet you wish
you were a real dog.

13
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:36,210
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

14
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,578
This is New York.If you can make it here.

15
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,283
you can make it anywhere...

16
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,452
you ugly, smelly...

17
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:55,630
- Verdell!
- Uh-oh.

18
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,808
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

19
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:05,971
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,488
- Mr. Udall?
- Mm-hmm?

21
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,184
Have you seen Verdell?

22
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,089
What does he look like?

23
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:22,630
My dog. You know, my...

24
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,969
My dog with the little,
adorable face.

25
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:28,773
Don't you know
what my dog looks like?

26
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,544
Oh, I got it.
You were talking about your dog.

27
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:36,020
I thought it was the name
of that colored man I see in the hall.

28
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,059
Which color was that?

29
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,497
Like thick molasses...

30
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,759
- with a broad nose...
- Frank!

31
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,661
perfect for smelling
trouble and prison food.

32
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,903
- Simon, you've got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.

33
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,305
How are you doin'?

34
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:57,308
Frank shows my work,
Mr. Udall.

35
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:59,576
- I think you know that.
- People are gonna start coming.

36
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,019
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around me...

37
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:07,149
I don't give a rat crap
what or where you shove your show.

38
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:09,993
Are we done
being neighbors for now?

39
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,132
- Let me talk to you...
- No! Not worth it.

40
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:20,265
Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

41
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,175
Okay.

42
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:28,004
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

43
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,445
You don't love anything,
Mr. Udall.

44
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:54,972
One, two, three, four, five.

45
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:59,141
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,418
Okay.

47
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,644
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

48
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:47,874
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank, where is he?

49
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,007
- Isn't he here? He lives here.
- Take it easy.

50
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,918
- He had a little thing with the dog.
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.

51
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,353
He's adorable.

52
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,221
Who buys more than me?
He isn't the only one working.

53
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,854
Good Lord.
Where have you been?

54
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,866
Oh, look at my boy.

55
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,633
Look at him.

56
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,907
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

57
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,013
Where was my little baby?

58
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:22,022
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

59
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:30,193
- Go ahead,John. You earned your fun.
- Sorry. It just struck me.

60
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,895
- It's funny.
- Oh, wait.

61
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,835
How did he get down
in the basement...

62
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:38,842
even if he got
in the elevator?

63
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:43,510
Maybe some nice neighbor
shoved him down the garbage chute?

64
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:45,988
Somewhere in the dark...

65
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,114
Somewhere in the dark...

66
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,955
she had confessed,
and he had forgiven.

67
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:54,929
"This is what you live for,"
he said.

68
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:58,866
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval...

69
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,961
and there is only the safety...

70
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,132
of being with each other."

71
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,609
How, she wondered,
could she find such hope...

72
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,705
in the most shameful part of her?

73
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:15,515
At last she was able
to define love.

74
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:18,050
Love was...

75
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,116
Mr. Udall, I'd like
to speak to you, please.

76
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:23,823
Let me do this by myself.

77
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:27,061
- Love was...
- Are you in there?

78
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,466
Son of a bitch!

79
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:31,736
Pansy-ass stool pusher.

80
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,537
Yes?

81
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,574
Maybe this can wait.

82
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,674
I found Verdell.

83
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:50,394
Well, that's a load off.

84
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:54,593
Uh-huh.
Did you do something to him?

85
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,501
Do you realize
that I work at home?

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,599
I wasn't aware.

87
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:05,874
Do you like to be interrupted when
you're nancing around in your garden?

88
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:10,978
No. I actually...

89
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,988
will turn the ringer off on my phone
and put cardboard...

90
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:16,923
Well, I work all the time...

91
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:21,226
so never, never interrupt me,
okay?

92
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,927
Not if there's a fire.

93
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,267
Not even if you hear the sound
of a thud from my home...

94
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,863
and one week later there's
a smell coming from there...

95
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,774
that can only be
a decaying human body...

96
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,778
and you have to hold a hanky
to your face...

97
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:37,078
because the stench is so thick
you think you're gonna faint.

98
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:40,416
Even then,
don't come knocking.

99
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:43,754
Or if it's election night...

100
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:46,522
and you're excited
and you want to celebrate...

101
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,653
because some fudge packer
you date...

102
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:52,167
has been elected the first queer
president of the United States...

103
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:54,829
and he's going to have you...

104
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:57,566
down to Camp David...

105
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,770
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

106
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,337
Even then...

107
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,178
don't knock...

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,446
not on this door...

109
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,785
not for any reason.

110
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,950
Do you get me, sweetheart?

111
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:17,959
Yes.

112
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:22,128
It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

113
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,305
Okay then.

114
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:42,287
So the theory of confrontations says:
"Think twice before messing with me."

115
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:50,068
All right.

116
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,840
Love was...

117
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,312
What was love?

118
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,583
Love was...

119
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,851
Now I am pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

120
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,058
Don't touch! Don't touch!

121
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:19,262
Shut up! You think you can intimidate
the whole world with your attitude.

122
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,738
You don't intimidate me.
I grew up in hell, homeboy.

123
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,072
My grandmother had more attitude.

124
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:28,706
Police!
Donut-munching morons.

125
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,980
Help me!

126
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:33,850
Shut up!

127
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:36,413
Assault and battery,
and you're black!

128
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:41,020
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable...

129
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:44,554
if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

130
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,138
Meantime...

131
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,666
I'm gonna think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

132
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,475
I hate doing this!

133
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:58,982
I'm an art dealer.

134
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:03,653
Have a nice day.
Okay, party!

135
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,848
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Don't touch.

136
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,475
Get a life.

137
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:32,712
- Watch it.
- Don't touch.

138
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,626
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

139
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:47,400
You know all my son's stuff, right?
No, no. I got a date tonight.

140
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,966
I'm walking out and he says,
"Mom, I promise not to get...

141
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:52,377
one of my fevers or coughs
during your date."

142
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,540
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

143
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,084
It came out of me: "You love me
the way you love your remote control.

144
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,818
As long as I switch every time
you press one of my buttons."

145
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:04,826
That's terrific.

146
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:07,955
People that talk in metaphors
oughta shampoo my crotch.

147
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:13,402
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

148
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,632
- No, pay me next week.
- I owe you.

149
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,640
I told you today.
That's the rule.

150
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,734
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

151
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,045
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,423
Pardon me.

153
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,085
Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

154
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:37,563
This way you take a cab home
so you can get ready for the date.

155
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,431
Ready is not my problem.

156
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:41,902
I'm starving.

157
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:45,272
Go on. Sit down. You know
you're not allowed back here.

158
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,105
Spence is more excited than I am.

159
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:51,012
He says, "I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

160
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,712
Sometimes this kid,
you just want to...

161
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,550
I've gotJews at my table.

162
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:00,217
It's not your table.
It's the place's table. Behave.

163
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,352
This once you can sit
at someone else's station.

164
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,292
Or you can wait your turn.

165
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,973
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

166
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,944
How much more you got to eat?

167
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,148
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

168
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:27,486
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

169
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,757
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how many books he sells.

170
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,287
- Give him one more chance. Here I go.
- Barred for life.

171
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:47,939
- They left.
- Yeah. What do you know?

172
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,946
Bryan says he doesn't care
how long you've been coming.

173
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,424
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

174
00:12:57,494 --> 00:13:00,588
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

175
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,363
Three eggs over easy...

176
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,801
two sausage,
six strips of bacon with fries.

177
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,771
Fries today.

178
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,004
A short stack,
coffee with cream and sweetener.

179
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,172
You're gonna die soon
with that diet.

180
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,843
We're all gonna die soon.
I will, you will.

181
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,012
It sure sounds like
your son will.

182
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,576
If you ever mention my son again...

183
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,513
you will never be able
to eat here again, understand?

184
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:57,428
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

185
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:03,995
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

186
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:10,770
Do you?

187
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,584
Yes.

188
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,961
- Yeah?
- Yes.

189
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,459
I'll get your order.

190
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,971
Wear my earrings tonight.

191
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,137
It's just so interesting
what you said at dinner.

192
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,547
You said it
like it was nothing.

193
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:51,594
Where's the bedroom?

194
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:56,326
This is sort of it.
I sort of sleep in here.

195
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,680
Don't worry about it.

196
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:34,476
What?

197
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,879
I don't know.

198
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:47,522
Grandma.

199
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,155
Maybe you'd better check.

200
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,166
What did you think
I was gonna do?

201
00:15:57,071 --> 00:16:00,200
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mama!

202
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,210
I was hearing everything
that you were doing...

203
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,679
so I put these on
to give you privacy.

204
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:10,413
- So how was dinner?
- Hey, pal.

205
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,216
- How's your friend?
- Are you okay?

206
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:15,257
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

207
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,419
Scootch over.

208
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:21,555
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- A nice place.

209
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,063
I have him.

210
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:29,572
- One more spit?
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

211
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:32,304
- Go.
- She has me.

212
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:34,711
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

213
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:38,182
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

214
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:41,279
I'm okay, Mom.
She has me. Go.

215
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,929
Close the curtains.

216
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,738
No, you can't smoke!
He can't take smoke!

217
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,943
- Magic.
- Oh.

218
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,985
Oh, God.
Well, that'll teach you.

219
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,960
I don't even notice it anymore.

220
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,691
All right. Come here.

221
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,280
You don't have to get that embarrassed.
It's a little bit of throw up.

222
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,509
Little bit of throw up.

223
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:38,611
Well, what shall we do?

224
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,853
Want me to write which trains you take
to get home, or you wanna lay down...

225
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,761
No, no.
I'll take a cab.

226
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,940
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

227
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,682
I just can't. I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

228
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:07,714
Carl, take me off the speaker,
Did I tell you these are house seats?

229
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,157
you could use a break,

230
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:12,788
Hello, Carl?

231
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,798
you there?

232
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:19,031
Okay. I just found a model.

233
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:24,841
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

234
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,844
Carl, right?

235
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,910
Hey, what's going on?

236
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:36,013
- Remember?
- I only need one.

237
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:39,824
You picked me up maybe a few weeks,
I don't know, some time ago.

238
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:42,091
This is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

239
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,028
Portrait?

240
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:48,936
I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

241
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,701
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.

242
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,334
- I don't get it.
- Do you read?

243
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,850
Who is it, baby?

244
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,724
Who is that, Verdell?

245
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,225
I'm sorry.
I told you today.

246
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,565
I was in the studio doing work,
and I just...

247
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,798
It's out here.

248
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,242
- Sure have great things.
- Gershwin is great, isn't he?

249
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:24,508
I usually make a big deal
about picking models...

250
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:26,572
but Carl is so thorough.

251
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:29,448
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your resume, huh?

252
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:35,717
This is not a nude.

253
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:41,495
just kidding around.

254
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:43,831
So much for love.

255
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:46,904
Yet another pose.

256
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,944
Exactly what is
your previous experience?

257
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:54,312
How about that, hmm?
I'm running out of ideas here.

258
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,578
Then give me some direction.

259
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:00,519
Nothing.

260
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,855
I just watch until something
strikes me.

261
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:06,919
I mean, do anything
that you think of.

262
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:11,368
Wait for me to say "hold that pose,"
then try to comfortably hold it.

263
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,673
No direction.

264
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,344
Okay.

265
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,779
What I do is watch.

266
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:27,054
You ever watch somebody
who doesn't know you're watching them?

267
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,353
An old woman
sitting on a bus...

268
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,552
or kids going to school...

269
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:34,561
or somebody just waiting.

270
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:38,259
And you see this flash
come over them...

271
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:42,466
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external...

272
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,030
because that hasn't changed.

273
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,941
And when you see it,
they're sort of realer...

274
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:49,171
and they're more alive.

275
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,676
If you look at somebody long enough,
you discover their humanity.

276
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,689
Wow.

277
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:02,256
I know exactly what you mean.

278
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:09,894
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

279
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,107
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

280
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:23,252
- Sorry.
- I got on the third line of dialogue,

281
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:27,621
I blanked. I had no clue
as to what the next line was.

282
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:31,060
- Ignores me.
- He said to me, "Last chance."

283
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,155
- Last chance.
- Oh, God.

284
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,630
I came back in.

285
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,564
Here she comes
to ignore me again.

286
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:39,435
I messed up
on the exact same line.

287
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,031
- Guess what.
- What?

288
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,043
He cast me!

289
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:46,478
just what the world needs...
another actress.

290
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:48,641
Okay, okay.

291
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:58,626
Can't live without me, huh?

292
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:02,495
I'm finally gonna ask.

293
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:06,628
What's with the plastic
picnic ware?

294
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:08,901
Why don't you try ours?
You're afraid it isn't clean?

295
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:12,342
- You okay?
- I see the help. It's a judgment call.

296
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:15,881
So give yourself
a little pep talk.

297
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,441
Must try other people's
clean silverware...

298
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,011
as part of fun
of dining out.

299
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,590
What's wrong with your son?

300
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,151
Yeah. What do you care?

301
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:40,640
He's got to fight to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

302
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:42,441
He's allergic to dust.

303
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:46,107
This is New York, so his immune system
bails on him whenever there's trouble.

304
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:49,678
So an ear infection...
Is this bothering you?

305
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:57,724
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to
the emergency room six times a month...

306
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:02,200
where I get whatever nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

307
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,330
Nice chatting with you.

308
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,741
- His name?
- Spencer.

309
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:11,839
Okay.

310
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:16,177
Spence.

311
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:21,526
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

312
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:25,586
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

313
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:38,470
You can put on anything you want now.
I might be sort of done here.

314
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:41,573
For two weeks all we've done is work.
Let's play!

315
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,286
Vincent!

316
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,432
So you're practically finished, huh?

317
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,740
Yeah.
There is one more stage.

318
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,644
Where you going?

319
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,778
No place.
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

320
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:29,795
- You want some chocolate?
- No, he's not allowed.

321
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:32,170
Wait.

322
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:35,507
I gotta take off.
You want to say good-bye or anything?

323
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,209
- He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

324
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:42,650
I'm gonna look
at the painting.

325
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,092
Where are you going, sweetheart?

326
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,391
You want some water?
What is the matter with you?

327
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,663
You want some water?

328
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,705
Simon, wait!

329
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,522
Why are you doing this?

330
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:21,157
No. No, wait.

331
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:22,723
See.

332
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:25,032
- That painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

333
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,175
Excuse me.

334
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:40,086
- Help me!
- We gotta go.

335
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:44,019
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

336
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:59,443
So you call 9-1 -1
and don't leave your name?

337
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:00,773
That's right.

338
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:03,510
Even a dumb geezer should know
Emergency automatically...

339
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,744
- No one got killed.
- Oh, is he dead?

340
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:07,251
Ask him.

341
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,686
What's wrong with you?

342
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:11,553
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name ya.

343
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:16,723
We will. If we can't, we'll come back
and ask you again and again.

344
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,893
What, you're trying to
intimidate me with that attitude?

345
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:23,803
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

346
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:27,538
Go shake down a 7-Eleven
for a day-old wiener.

347
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:31,138
It's just a matter of time, sir.
There's a painting of one of the guys.

348
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,149
Get some tape on it.

349
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:37,921
I've been praying for him
since I heard.

350
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,287
So, anyway, I'm on my way
to the hospital.

351
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,953
If you could just
watch the dog tonight.

352
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:49,067
- I'm sorry. No.
- Okay. Thanks.

353
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:51,104
Old bitch.

354
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:53,106
Damn dog.

355
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:59,977
You're taking him.
Yes, you are!

356
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,313
Get the hell out of the way!

357
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:05,583
You're taking him.
This will even the books. One night.

358
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,789
Wait, wait.

359
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:12,660
Do you want to say no to me?

360
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,164
Huh?

361
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,105
I don't want to say nothing
to you.

362
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:25,208
Because I've never felt as crazy
as I do right now.

363
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,439
I almost want you to say no.

364
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:33,981
Thanks for looking after him.

365
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:36,890
Hey! Where are you going?

366
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,056
- You can't do this.
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

367
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,066
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before.

368
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:49,800
Hey, Frank.

369
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:39,790
You're dead.

370
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:45,872
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

371
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,703
You'll eat what we got,
what we eat.

372
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,915
All right.

373
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:00,921
Don't do anything.

374
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,744
Where's the trust?

375
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,749
Never a break.

376
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,022
Dogs.

377
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:46,107
Always look at the bright side
of your life

378
00:29:49,548 --> 00:29:54,383
Always look at the lighter side
of your life

379
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,964
God.

380
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:06,168
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

381
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:09,001
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

382
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:11,197
and we haven't sold
a single painting.

383
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:13,332
We can't reduce the price
at this stage.

384
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,004
What...
I'm in a free fall here.

385
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,876
- Yes?
- We can see him.

386
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:20,849
Okay. I'll meet you in there.

387
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,410
I will meet you in there.

388
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,420
Okay? One minute.

389
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,390
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

390
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,726
How are you doing, great one?

391
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,030
I haven't looked at myself yet.

392
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,399
I figured I could tell
from your reaction.

393
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,268
Oh, God.

394
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,405
That bad, huh?

395
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,906
I talked to the doctor,
and... Oh!

396
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:51,045
Okay. It's not that bad.

397
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:54,453
The doctors say you're gonna be
your old self in a couple of weeks.

398
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,116
The scars might take...

399
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:58,788
Oh, shit!

400
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:07,562
-Jackie.
- Yes?

401
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,732
Can you hand me a mirror,
please?

402
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:21,219
Wait.
I have a smaller one.

403
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:35,728
So how are things anyway?

404
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:37,434
How's Verdell?

405
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:39,942
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall.

406
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:42,104
Taking care of him.

407
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,512
How could you do that?

408
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,551
- No, Simon.
- He'll hurt him.

409
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,453
I promise. Not a chance.

410
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:52,356
I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

411
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:54,290
I'm always on the move.

412
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,530
Trust me.

413
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,362
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

414
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:03,427
Your dog is fine, Simon.

415
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:07,174
Okay.

416
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:12,147
Waiting gives the devil time.

417
00:32:30,103 --> 00:32:32,037
Oh, my.

418
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:44,718
Where did I go?

419
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:48,153
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

420
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:54,193
What are you doing
with a dog?

421
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,132
Suckered in, set up,
pushed around.

422
00:32:57,202 --> 00:33:00,170
You're not worried
someone might take it?

423
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:05,435
No, not until now,
for Christ's sake.

424
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,945
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

425
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,242
Hey, puppy.

426
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,411
He's cute.

427
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:16,456
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

428
00:33:16,524 --> 00:33:18,115
I wonder what breed he is.

429
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,398
He's a little dog.

430
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:28,597
Next time, if Bryan's not here,
you can bring him in.

431
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:33,370
How old are you?

432
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,969
If I guessed by your eyes,
I'd say you were 50.

433
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,442
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

434
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:43,420
So much for eyes.
How old are you?

435
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,252
You brought it up.

436
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:47,988
- No, I'm curious.
- Not that you're ugly.

437
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:51,463
Yeah. Easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

438
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:55,229
But my knees knock when you
turn on the charm full blast.

439
00:33:56,438 --> 00:33:59,999
But I mean,
what's with the dark?

440
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:04,640
Dawn patrol.

441
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:08,675
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

442
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:13,122
This time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

443
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:15,922
- So I get him home...
- No, no!

444
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,526
The dog.
The bacon's for the dog.

445
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:27,504
Last week I was playing the piano
for him, and he likes it.

446
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:31,510
So I decided I'm gonna...

447
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,945
make a joke.

448
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,538
So you're all set here.

449
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,048
Yeah.

450
00:34:42,825 --> 00:34:46,057
I think it's a beautiful day
for our walk today.

451
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,063
Very nice.

452
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:02,909
Look at that. Look at him.

453
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:04,745
I gotta give you something.

454
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:08,346
I gotta give you something
real good too.

455
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:12,382
I'm gonna show it to you.
Come on, buddy.

456
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,563
Don't you be like me.

457
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:19,659
You stay just the way you are,
because you are a perfect man...

458
00:35:19,736 --> 00:35:22,534
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

459
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:26,805
- What you love. Hear me?
- I'd like to be treated like that.

460
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:31,212
I'm gonna take you home right now
and get you something. Yes.

461
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:33,443
Let's go home
and do some writing.

462
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:36,778
He had made the girl happy...

463
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:40,019
and what a girl.

464
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:42,960
"You saved my life," she said.

465
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:47,701
"You'd better make it up to me."

466
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:52,405
Done.

467
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:57,140
Yes, I hate the doggie.

468
00:35:57,213 --> 00:35:59,647
Ooh, 62 books.

469
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:01,910
Done.

470
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:02,118
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

471
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,611
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

472
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:07,920
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

473
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:12,657
These are the food receipts here,
the household expenses.

474
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:14,665
Here's one for the dog again.

475
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:17,327
- I can read it. I got it.
- There you go.

476
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:20,270
- All the laundry and cleaners.
- Okay, good.

477
00:36:22,476 --> 00:36:24,500
Boy, look at that, huh?

478
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:28,675
Oh, he likes it
at Chez Melvin, hmm?

479
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,281
What are you coming over here for?
I told you to sit here.

480
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:37,758
I can't cook with a dog near me.
Okay,just sit. Good.

481
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:40,819
We don't want any company.
I'll read you some Ralph Waldo Emerson.

482
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,831
Okay, have it your way.

483
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,669
How's Verdell doing?

484
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:59,212
You know,
he's a pain in the ass.

485
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,987
Well.

486
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,183
Simon's home.

487
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:08,024
I was hoping you can keep the dog
until he's had a chance...

488
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:09,688
to think and adjust.

489
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:13,861
Oh, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

490
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:16,063
No, he definitely
wants him back right away.

491
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,140
He'll be by tomorrow.

492
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:23,039
Okay.

493
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:25,047
Okay by me.

494
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,920
Hungry.
I'll be right with you, pooch.

495
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:42,863
One, two, three, four, five.

496
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:52,710
I'm okay.

497
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:39,970
Mr. Udall.

498
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:49,910
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

499
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:52,178
Could you take it...

500
00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:54,744
just...

501
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:57,313
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

502
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:03,425
Thank you.

503
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:11,867
Come here, my beautiful boy.

504
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,967
Come here, boy.

505
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:16,205
Let's go home and get well.

506
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:20,650
You can't blame him
for being weird.

507
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:24,946
Have a look at yourself
in the mirror.

508
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,718
Thank you.

509
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,533
Come on, sweetheart.

510
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,538
Come here, boy.

511
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:45,247
I know what you want.

512
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,386
Where's my boy?

513
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,562
Don't force him.

514
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:33,903
Over a dog.

515
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,640
Over an ugly dog.

516
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:50,519
Worst sidewalk in New York.

517
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,524
Look where they put it.

518
00:40:59,234 --> 00:41:01,134
Help!

519
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:04,639
If you want to see me,
you will make an appointment.

520
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:08,642
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

521
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:11,681
and then act as though I had
some choice about barging in?

522
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:13,978
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

523
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:17,987
You said you could help me.
What was that, a tease?

524
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:20,957
I can help you
if you take responsibility...

525
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:23,519
- to keep regular appointments.
- You changed the room around.

526
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:26,498
Two years ago.
I also regrew my beard.

527
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,160
But you're not interested
in changes in me.

528
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:33,264
I don't have this mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

529
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:36,833
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

530
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,038
- Yes.
- Thank you.

531
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:42,015
No, we're not doing this now.

532
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:47,022
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

533
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:01,567
What if this is
as good as it gets?

534
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,586
What the heck are those for?

535
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,056
No. Get Carol.

536
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:24,862
I'm filling in.

537
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,869
We don't know
if she's coming back.

538
00:42:26,938 --> 00:42:29,930
She might be getting a job
closer to home.

539
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:35,178
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

540
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:39,073
What the heck do you mean?

541
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:40,710
Look, elephant girl...

542
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:43,813
just go get Carol or something.

543
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,552
just have her do
my one meal here.

544
00:42:46,626 --> 00:42:48,891
I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

545
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:54,061
Do it!

546
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:59,702
- Bryan, code blue.
- What happened?

547
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:08,481
Out!
just shut up and get out!

548
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,849
Do it!

549
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,254
I'll be quiet.

550
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:15,759
just let me stay here.

551
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:18,388
No problem.
Go get Carol.

552
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:21,592
Get her here.

553
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:25,503
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

554
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,734
I'm a great customer.

555
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:29,003
This day...

556
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,844
has been a disaster.

557
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:37,184
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

558
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:39,654
Get out immediately...

559
00:43:39,723 --> 00:43:42,122
or there's gonna be trouble.

560
00:43:42,192 --> 00:43:44,126
Man, I mean it.

561
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:54,669
Okay.

562
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,513
See ya. Good-bye.

563
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:04,345
It's about time!

564
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:08,154
Carol's last name.

565
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:12,821
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

566
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:16,554
Hey, Dad, I'm over here!

567
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:22,966
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

568
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,336
What can you do?

569
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:34,911
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

570
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:37,149
Why not? You're a good girl.

571
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:38,656
Hello.

572
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:55,436
Christ.

573
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:15,894
I'm hungry.

574
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:20,571
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

575
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:22,268
What are you doing here?

576
00:45:22,343 --> 00:45:25,403
This is not a sexist thing.
If you were a waiter...

577
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:28,382
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home.

578
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:34,218
I'm trying to keep emotion
out of this...

579
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,781
even though it's
an important issue to me...

580
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,160
and I have very strong feelings
on the subject.

581
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:41,993
What subject?

582
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:44,762
That I wasn't there to take crap
from you and bring you eggs?

583
00:45:44,836 --> 00:45:48,067
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

584
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:57,011
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

585
00:45:58,453 --> 00:46:00,477
And to prove it...

586
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:03,149
I have not gotten personal,
and you have.

587
00:46:04,993 --> 00:46:07,188
Why aren't you at work?

588
00:46:07,263 --> 00:46:08,855
You sick?

589
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,468
You don't look sick.

590
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,338
just tired and bitter.

591
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,204
My son is sick, okay?

592
00:46:26,753 --> 00:46:28,811
What about your mother?

593
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,613
How do you know
about my mother?

594
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,519
I hear you talking
while I wait.

595
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:39,055
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One second.

596
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:50,071
How're you doing?

597
00:46:56,987 --> 00:46:59,479
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

598
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:02,924
Melvin, that's it. I cannot handle
you teaching my son manners!

599
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,100
Back to life.

600
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:20,011
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

601
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:22,983
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand...

602
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:26,214
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand...

603
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:27,722
bingo.

604
00:47:29,258 --> 00:47:33,285
- 1 04.9.
- Let's treat ourselves to a cab ride.

605
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:37,628
Look out, you guys.
Coming through.

606
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:44,034
- Mom!
- We're okay.

607
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,539
Melvin, wait!

608
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,042
Melvin, wait!

609
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:59,489
Shut up, kids!

610
00:48:01,864 --> 00:48:03,797
Give us a lift,
would you, Melvin?

611
00:48:03,866 --> 00:48:05,799
A lift. Okay.

612
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:11,331
Cover your mouth
when you cough, kid.

613
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:16,670
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
and quickly, please.

614
00:48:16,748 --> 00:48:18,511
Okay.

615
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,277
- Hospital?
- Yes.

616
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:23,753
- Could you be back at work today?
- No!

617
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:26,348
Stay away from me!
God!

618
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:30,029
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

619
00:48:30,029 --> 00:48:33,625
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

620
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,295
I feel terrible that I have to...

621
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,202
- Simon.
- Huh?

622
00:48:38,273 --> 00:48:41,436
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

623
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:44,703
Sorry.

624
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:51,313
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

625
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,379
He thought I should have notes
so I did this right...

626
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,860
maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

627
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:03,294
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

628
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:10,974
Simon, you're broke.

629
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:16,514
The medical bills
are $61 ,000 now...

630
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,486
and the show didn't go well.

631
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:20,851
I've spoken to your parents.

632
00:49:20,923 --> 00:49:23,585
They didn't hang up
or anything...

633
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:26,992
but they said they would
feel strange about calling you.

634
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:31,330
Well, I can't call them.

635
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,494
Come here, baby.

636
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,741
Verdell. What's wrong?

637
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:44,407
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am, sweetheart!

638
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,747
Happy to see me,
you little pissant mop?

639
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,688
How about another ride
down the chute?

640
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:52,249
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

641
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:54,419
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

642
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:56,292
Sorry. I'm sorry.

643
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:01,368
I'll be able to keep
my apartment and the studio...

644
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:03,370
won't I?

645
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:09,210
Wow.

646
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,406
Oh, my God.

647
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,917
Yes, you write more than everybody else
and make us a lot of money.

648
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:45,921
- But it's more appropriate...
- Look.

649
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:50,288
I need this.
just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

650
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:52,024
Okay?

651
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:58,826
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good.

652
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:04,002
On a pleasanter note, my son
just got accepted to Brown.

653
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:06,238
My husband was dying.

654
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,806
Yeah. Good, nice,
thrilled, exciting.

655
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:12,376
You don't have to wait with me.

656
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:20,961
I can't resist.

657
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:23,295
You usually move
through here so quickly.

658
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:26,700
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

659
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:30,366
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

660
00:51:30,442 --> 00:51:32,342
What does it mean to you?

661
00:51:33,913 --> 00:51:38,817
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

662
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:42,514
Oh, God.
This is like a nightmare.

663
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:47,255
just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

664
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,659
How do you write women so well?

665
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,964
I think of a man...

666
00:51:55,038 --> 00:51:57,939
and I take away reason
and accountability.

667
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,789
- Where's my newspaper?
- It's right here, Mrs. Garrett.

668
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:22,033
"M.D."

669
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:31,002
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

670
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:33,810
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

671
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:36,113
What? Please,just tell me.

672
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:40,621
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.
- Not your name!

673
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:44,183
- Don't tell me your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

674
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:46,923
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

675
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,900
- Did you know docs come to your house?
- No, I didn't.

676
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:52,732
- I'm home!
- So what are you doing here?

677
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:55,831
-I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
-What?

678
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:59,072
- Oh, you met the gift.
- He's good.

679
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:03,777
- I'm an expert on doctors.
- Okay, Doctor.

680
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:08,747
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

681
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:11,554
She said I was to take excellent care
of this little guy...

682
00:53:11,628 --> 00:53:14,358
because you are urgently needed
back at work.

683
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:16,524
What kind of work do you do?

684
00:53:17,634 --> 00:53:20,263
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

685
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:25,899
Uh, yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

686
00:53:26,979 --> 00:53:29,914
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

687
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,576
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

688
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:35,918
Tell them I need CBC, differential,
platelets, the whole thing.

689
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,321
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

690
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:41,326
I'm sorry. Did you say you're gonna
get the results back today?

691
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:43,329
Sure. Let's sit down.

692
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:48,760
These are the receipts
from all the prescriptions...

693
00:53:48,837 --> 00:53:51,102
from the beginning of the year.

694
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:55,702
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days...

695
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:58,441
and how he felt
and what he's been eating.

696
00:53:58,516 --> 00:54:02,077
That's very good.
How long has he had the problem?

697
00:54:02,153 --> 00:54:04,849
Since forever. Six months old.

698
00:54:04,923 --> 00:54:07,757
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

699
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,125
Only in the emergency room
or when he was well?

700
00:54:10,197 --> 00:54:14,133
- Emergency room only.
- How about skin testing for allergies?

701
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:17,501
- No.
- No standard scratch test?

702
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:22,737
No. I asked. They said my plan
didn't cover it and it wasn't necessary.

703
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:25,371
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

704
00:54:25,447 --> 00:54:28,848
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

705
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:34,448
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, that's their technical name.

706
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:38,992
So, once the tests come back...

707
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:42,033
is there someone in your office
we should talk to to get the results?

708
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,265
Um, me. My home number's on the card.

709
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:49,706
That's his home number.

710
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:59,420
- What?
- It's your home number!

711
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:07,653
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or some coffee?

712
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:10,859
- No, thank you.
- A couple of female slaves?

713
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,632
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do...

714
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:17,765
a lot of things
I have to find out here.

715
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:21,710
But look, whatever I find out,
I promise you, at the very least...

716
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:25,944
from now on your son is going to feel
a great deal better, okay?

717
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,453
Doc!

718
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:43,304
No. Oh, fine. Okay.

719
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:44,963
That's good.

720
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:54,042
So, listen, you gotta let me know
about the additional costs.

721
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,414
One way or another, we'll...

722
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:57,885
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

723
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:03,253
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

724
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,868
That's wonderful!

725
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:17,268
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

726
00:56:17,345 --> 00:56:22,010
Forgive my recent crankiness.
I'll call when things get back on track.

727
00:56:30,094 --> 00:56:31,994
Huh? What's wrong?

728
00:56:32,062 --> 00:56:35,589
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?
- Oh, no!

729
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:57,422
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

730
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:03,655
Would there be any way
that you would be willing...

731
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:05,827
to walk his dog for him?

732
00:57:05,903 --> 00:57:07,461
Absolutely.

733
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:11,035
You're a wonderful man.

734
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:17,546
2:00 would be a good time,
and here is the key...

735
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:19,675
in case he is asleep.

736
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:22,886
Open his curtains for him...

737
00:57:22,955 --> 00:57:26,220
so he can see God's beautiful work.

738
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:30,525
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

739
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:36,160
Did they teach you to talk like this
in some "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

740
00:57:36,237 --> 00:57:39,207
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

741
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:42,904
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

742
00:57:54,126 --> 00:57:58,118
A seriously goofy man is behind this.
You're not allowed to block that out.

743
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:00,530
Do you really want to go
back to Emergency...

744
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,694
where those runt doctors
keep telling us that they can't help?

745
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,968
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

746
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:09,009
You know how this will turn out.
Come on!

747
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:15,044
You know how this will turn out.

748
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,881
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

749
00:58:17,954 --> 00:58:20,353
You don't send this one back.

750
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:25,955
Right?

751
00:58:32,404 --> 00:58:35,601
No, I do, I understand,

752
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:38,164
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

753
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:44,449
Bye-bye.

754
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:53,958
What a day. Come here.

755
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,964
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

756
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,557
Thank you for walking him.

757
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,438
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling so well.

758
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:07,500
This place smells like shit.

759
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,011
Go away.

760
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:13,911
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please,just leave!

761
00:59:17,223 --> 00:59:19,384
What happened to your queer
party friends?

762
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,017
Get outta here!

763
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:30,430
Nothing worse than having to feel
this way in front of you.

764
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:33,998
Nellie, you're a disgrace
to depression.

765
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:39,537
Rot in hell, Melvin.

766
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:42,584
No need to stop being a lady.

767
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:44,177
Quit worrying.

768
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,281
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

769
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,568
Is this fun for you?

770
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:03,532
You lucky devil. It just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

771
01:00:03,611 --> 01:00:06,239
I'm losing my apartment.

772
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:11,877
And Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

773
01:00:11,953 --> 01:00:13,922
And I won't.

774
01:00:13,991 --> 01:00:17,358
I don't want to paint anymore.

775
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:20,988
So the life that I was trying for
is over.

776
01:00:21,065 --> 01:00:23,225
The life that I had is gone...

777
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:27,532
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself
that it's difficult to breathe.

778
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:30,166
It's high times for you, isn't it?

779
01:00:30,242 --> 01:00:33,905
The gay neighbor is terrified.

780
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,276
Terrified!

781
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:50,458
I was just trying to give you a boost.

782
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:53,835
Lucky you.

783
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:56,667
You're here for rock bottom...

784
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,676
you absolute horror of a human being.

785
01:01:13,927 --> 01:01:18,159
The one thing I'll do for you...
I might cheer you up.

786
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:20,723
Get out.

787
01:01:21,802 --> 01:01:24,294
You wanna know
why the dog prefers me?

788
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:27,364
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

789
01:01:30,814 --> 01:01:33,407
I keep bacon in my pocket.

790
01:01:34,517 --> 01:01:35,448
See?

791
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:38,687
Oh, my gosh.

792
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:45,795
We'll both call him.
You'll see.

793
01:01:45,864 --> 01:01:47,297
It's a trick.

794
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:58,177
Come here, Verdell.

795
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,511
Come on.

796
01:02:07,923 --> 01:02:11,256
Come here, baby. It's okay.

797
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,332
just stupid. A stupid dog.

798
01:02:21,973 --> 01:02:23,406
Could you leave now?

799
01:02:25,177 --> 01:02:26,610
Please?

800
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:30,147
I don't get it.

801
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,104
Taxi!

802
01:03:57,952 --> 01:04:01,286
Watch again with Nick At Nite's
Classic TVRewind,

803
01:04:01,357 --> 01:04:04,019
On repeat viewing,
one begins to suspect...

804
01:04:04,093 --> 01:04:08,189
that might not really be Major Healy
in the phone booth after all,

805
01:04:12,136 --> 01:04:14,503
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

806
01:04:25,401 --> 01:04:28,166
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

807
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,177
If you're, uh...

808
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:44,052
If you're worried about thanking me...

809
01:04:45,425 --> 01:04:46,916
That's not why I'm here.

810
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:51,559
Though you have no idea what it's like
to have a real conversation...

811
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:53,295
with a doctor about Spencer.

812
01:04:55,873 --> 01:04:58,501
Note. Put it in a note.

813
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:11,682
I have a hair dryer...

814
01:05:12,627 --> 01:05:15,061
Why did you do this for me?

815
01:05:18,235 --> 01:05:20,601
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

816
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:25,074
Do you have some idea
how strange that sounds?

817
01:05:25,144 --> 01:05:26,577
Well, I mean...

818
01:05:26,646 --> 01:05:29,581
I'm worried you did this be...

819
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,699
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

820
01:05:52,846 --> 01:05:54,278
Look.

821
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:59,018
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

822
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:02,614
I don't think this can wait.
I need to clear this up now.

823
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,951
Clear what up?

824
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:10,530
I'm not going to sleep with you.

825
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:13,468
I will never sleep with you!
Never, ever!

826
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,804
Not ever!

827
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:25,952
I'm sorry, but...

828
01:06:27,756 --> 01:06:31,523
we don't open for the "no sex" oaths
until 9:00 a.m.

829
01:06:33,497 --> 01:06:34,931
I'm not kidding.

830
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,100
Anything else?

831
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,399
just...

832
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:47,713
thank you.

833
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:53,888
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

834
01:06:58,396 --> 01:06:59,988
Yes.

835
01:07:15,017 --> 01:07:17,075
"Never," she says.

836
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,747
I took a chance you were up.

837
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,482
I brought you some Chinese soup.

838
01:07:46,657 --> 01:07:48,249
Thanks.

839
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,945
I've never been this tired
in my life.

840
01:08:15,793 --> 01:08:17,728
I haven't been sleeping.

841
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,194
I haven't been clear in my head...

842
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:25,534
or felt like myself.

843
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:29,634
I'm in trouble.

844
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:34,573
It's not just the tiredness.

845
01:08:34,651 --> 01:08:38,382
- Boy.
- Sick. Nauseous.

846
01:08:38,455 --> 01:08:40,424
Sleepy.

847
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:42,653
Where everything looks distorted...

848
01:08:42,728 --> 01:08:44,855
and everything inside you...

849
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:49,300
kind of aches and you can barely find
the will to complain.

850
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:51,132
Yeah.

851
01:08:54,842 --> 01:08:57,744
I'm glad we did this.

852
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:01,241
Good talking to you.

853
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:12,363
You are not still writing
that thank-you note.

854
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:15,027
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

855
01:09:16,538 --> 01:09:20,134
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

856
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:23,770
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

857
01:09:25,615 --> 01:09:28,107
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

858
01:09:28,186 --> 01:09:31,279
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

859
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:34,724
You better start finding something else
to do with your free time.

860
01:09:35,929 --> 01:09:38,557
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yes.

861
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,065
All right. We got pizza.

862
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:44,299
Carol and I are going out.
Sausage and pepperoni.

863
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:46,602
You want to make this later
for you and Spencer?

864
01:09:48,344 --> 01:09:51,337
We are going out, like people do.

865
01:09:53,918 --> 01:09:57,182
If you can't feel good
about this break...

866
01:09:57,255 --> 01:10:00,419
and step out a little...

867
01:10:00,494 --> 01:10:03,292
then I think you
ought to have Mr. Udall...

868
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:05,525
send you over a psychiatrist.

869
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,502
I don't need one, because I know
what's really going on here!

870
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,402
I gotta finish this letter
or I'll go nuts.

871
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:17,072
This can't be right.
"Con-science?"

872
01:10:24,957 --> 01:10:26,049
What?

873
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,747
It's very weird now
not feeling that...

874
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:49,720
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

875
01:10:51,858 --> 01:10:55,021
Without that, I just
start thinking about myself.

876
01:10:55,095 --> 01:10:58,030
And what good does that
ever get anybody?

877
01:11:01,938 --> 01:11:05,466
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple...

878
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:07,510
and I felt myself...

879
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:10,879
giving them a dirty look.

880
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:18,290
I just had no idea everything was...

881
01:11:27,036 --> 01:11:28,628
Go ahead.

882
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:33,811
Moving in the wrong direction.

883
01:11:34,881 --> 01:11:37,041
Away from a time...

884
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:41,075
when I remembered what it was like
to have a man to anything.

885
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:43,884
Hold fucking...

886
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:47,154
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

887
01:11:47,229 --> 01:11:50,562
Hands with, for Christ's sake!

888
01:11:53,702 --> 01:11:57,503
I felt almost really bad...

889
01:11:57,575 --> 01:11:59,133
that Dr. Bettes is married.

890
01:12:03,349 --> 01:12:07,286
Which is probably why I make Spencer
hug me more than he wants to.

891
01:12:10,425 --> 01:12:12,359
Poor kid doesn't have enough problems.

892
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:15,362
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

893
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:21,537
Who needs these thoughts?

894
01:12:22,473 --> 01:12:25,533
So what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

895
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:28,239
Leave me be!
Why are you doing this?

896
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:30,806
What is it you want?

897
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,010
I hope getting me to think about
everything that's wrong...

898
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:35,055
when all I want to do
is not do that...

899
01:12:35,123 --> 01:12:37,057
has some purpose.

900
01:12:38,727 --> 01:12:43,165
Really, Mom, what is it you want?
What?

901
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:45,564
I want us to go out.

902
01:12:53,947 --> 01:12:56,210
Okay.

903
01:13:16,509 --> 01:13:17,999
Thank you.

904
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:20,308
Now I gotta send you
a thank-you note.

905
01:13:21,516 --> 01:13:25,077
Oh, look. Evelyn's here
and her giant,Joey.

906
01:13:28,425 --> 01:13:28,557
That's really
why you brought me here?

907
01:13:28,557 --> 01:13:30,855
That's really
why you brought me here?

908
01:13:30,927 --> 01:13:33,657
Well, you know,
it's not even mine.

909
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,791
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

910
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:40,999
But the dog did throw up
twice last night and his spark is off.

911
01:13:41,074 --> 01:13:44,010
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

912
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:48,310
They say his stomach's out of whack
and they need him for a couple of days.

913
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,940
Well, do it!

914
01:13:51,153 --> 01:13:53,816
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

915
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:58,182
- This is for later.
- What's this?

916
01:13:59,464 --> 01:14:01,955
- It's a note.
- A note?

917
01:14:03,034 --> 01:14:04,763
Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

918
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:06,964
Thank-you note? No, no.

919
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,565
- You can read it later.
- No, thank you.

920
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:11,373
No thank-you note.

921
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,380
Thank you.

922
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,352
She's nice.

923
01:14:26,263 --> 01:14:28,288
- Yeah.
- Real nice, huh?

924
01:14:28,366 --> 01:14:30,300
Really nice.

925
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:37,467
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
telling somebody, "No thanks required"?

926
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,576
Sure looks like it went over too.

927
01:14:44,387 --> 01:14:46,322
Look at you!

928
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:52,287
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

929
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,637
- What?
- Look at you.

930
01:14:59,706 --> 01:15:03,405
- You think I'm a mark.
- You helped with the dog and now this.

931
01:15:03,478 --> 01:15:06,344
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

932
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:09,510
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

933
01:15:09,586 --> 01:15:12,714
He's gotta get to Baltimore
to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

934
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:16,452
Well, yeah. I mean,
if his parents are alive.

935
01:15:16,528 --> 01:15:18,497
They have to help.
It's the rules.

936
01:15:18,564 --> 01:15:21,658
That's great.
Let them help him.

937
01:15:24,004 --> 01:15:26,269
Only, uh...

938
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,674
I got a high-maintenance selling painter
coming through, so I'm out.

939
01:15:31,747 --> 01:15:33,181
Can you drive him?

940
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:37,545
Think white and get serious.

941
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:40,949
Take my car. A convertible.

942
01:15:43,195 --> 01:15:44,924
Do you drive?

943
01:15:44,997 --> 01:15:48,057
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

944
01:15:48,135 --> 01:15:50,627
Gettin' loud.

945
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:55,103
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

946
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:57,873
I want your life for one minute,
where my big problem is...

947
01:15:57,947 --> 01:16:01,543
somebody offers me a free convertible
so I can get out of this city.

948
01:16:08,895 --> 01:16:12,559
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay, I'll do it.

949
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:14,259
I'll take him.

950
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,394
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

951
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,961
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

952
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,805
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

953
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,580
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

954
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:29,085
We don't enjoy one another that much.

955
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:37,363
If there is a mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you...

956
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,489
please be sure to let me know.

957
01:16:40,468 --> 01:16:42,332
Last-word freak.

958
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:46,033
- Good luck, lady.
- Was he talking to me?

959
01:16:46,109 --> 01:16:49,510
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

960
01:16:51,715 --> 01:16:54,548
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

961
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,052
What I did for you,
it's working out?

962
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,729
What you did changed my life.

963
01:17:14,644 --> 01:17:17,204
No thank-you note.

964
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:20,648
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life...

965
01:17:20,718 --> 01:17:22,687
which you won't read...

966
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:26,318
is that somehow
you have done more...

967
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:28,691
for my mother, my son...

968
01:17:28,762 --> 01:17:32,095
and me than anybody else ever has.

969
01:17:32,167 --> 01:17:35,330
I'm just gonna read you
this part of it.

970
01:17:37,173 --> 01:17:40,302
"And that makes you
the most important, surprising...

971
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:42,504
generous person
I ever met in my life...

972
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:45,481
and that you're gonna be
in our prayers...

973
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:47,485
our daily prayers forever."

974
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:50,046
Lovely.

975
01:17:52,559 --> 01:17:55,290
I also wrote one part
I'm just gonna say.

976
01:17:55,363 --> 01:17:56,921
I wrote, "I'm sorry."

977
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,132
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

978
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,473
when you came over and you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

979
01:18:07,544 --> 01:18:10,480
So I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that I...

980
01:18:10,549 --> 01:18:14,884
I was sorry for busting you on that
and busting in on you that night...

981
01:18:14,954 --> 01:18:16,387
when I said I was never...

982
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,424
I was sorry, and I'm sorry
for every time your food was cold...

983
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,434
and that you had to wait two seconds
for a coffee filler...

984
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,470
and I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant...

985
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:32,601
the human being that had it in him
to do this thing for us.

986
01:18:34,146 --> 01:18:36,341
You know what?
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

987
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:38,781
"I have not been able...

988
01:18:38,851 --> 01:18:41,412
to express my gratefulness to you.

989
01:18:41,488 --> 01:18:43,479
Even as I look
at the word 'grateful' now...

990
01:18:43,558 --> 01:18:45,583
it doesn't begin to tell you
what I feel."

991
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:54,767
That's nice of you.
Thank you.

992
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,374
Thank you.

993
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:11,148
Now I want you to do something for me.

994
01:19:19,737 --> 01:19:22,331
I'm sorry.
Didn't I say, "What?"

995
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:25,001
I thought I said "What?"

996
01:19:27,813 --> 01:19:28,905
What?

997
01:19:28,982 --> 01:19:31,348
I want you to go on this trip.

998
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,412
No, sir.

999
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:35,479
I can't do this without you.

1000
01:19:35,556 --> 01:19:39,754
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff"one eye" on me.

1001
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:41,490
I need you to chaperone.

1002
01:19:41,564 --> 01:19:44,056
Separate everything but cars.

1003
01:19:44,134 --> 01:19:46,694
You said you like convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

1004
01:19:46,771 --> 01:19:49,262
I'm sorry. The stiff"one eye"?

1005
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:51,367
- Two days.
- I can't. I work.

1006
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:53,935
- You get off when you want to.
- My son.

1007
01:19:54,013 --> 01:19:55,674
Bettes said he's doin' fine.

1008
01:19:57,384 --> 01:20:00,013
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What's that got to do with it?

1009
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:04,218
- I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note, ain't she sweet.

1010
01:20:04,293 --> 01:20:06,695
I need a hand,
and where did she go?

1011
01:20:06,764 --> 01:20:09,630
Are you saying accepting your help
obligates me?

1012
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:13,595
Is there any other way to see it?

1013
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,982
Here's a little suitcase...

1014
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:29,923
shocked that it's being used.

1015
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:41,635
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

1016
01:21:05,404 --> 01:21:09,307
- You're still comin', aren't you?
- yes,

1017
01:21:10,545 --> 01:21:12,672
I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1018
01:21:14,616 --> 01:21:19,054
just south of Baltimore, Maryland,
and I know what you're gonna say next.

1019
01:21:19,122 --> 01:21:22,387
I mean, I think I know,

1020
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,792
I'm not sure...

1021
01:21:24,862 --> 01:21:27,490
but I think so,

1022
01:21:27,566 --> 01:21:29,864
There's no need for me to bring
anything dressy?

1023
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,404
I didn't know...

1024
01:21:33,474 --> 01:21:35,998
if we were eating in any restaurants
that have dress codes.

1025
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:41,003
Well, I don't...

1026
01:21:41,082 --> 01:21:43,210
I mean, maybe,

1027
01:21:43,286 --> 01:21:45,549
I mean, yes! Let's.

1028
01:21:47,392 --> 01:21:48,483
Gotcha.

1029
01:21:51,664 --> 01:21:55,657
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

1030
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,830
Okay, then. Good night.

1031
01:22:04,613 --> 01:22:07,548
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1032
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,319
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

1033
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,621
Put him in with that one, not that one.
Builds his confidence.

1034
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:18,529
Lip kiss.

1035
01:22:22,402 --> 01:22:24,893
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1036
01:22:24,971 --> 01:22:28,100
Hey! Real sensitive!

1037
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:31,937
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

1038
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:42,851
Don't worry, Mom!
Have a good time!

1039
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:45,624
- Don't run.
- Have fun! Don't worry!

1040
01:22:45,698 --> 01:22:50,033
- Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

1041
01:22:54,443 --> 01:22:57,901
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

1042
01:22:57,981 --> 01:22:59,915
Give me a hug.

1043
01:23:01,886 --> 01:23:04,615
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

1044
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,282
Soak it up.

1045
01:23:08,026 --> 01:23:10,517
It's your last chance for a hug
for a few days.

1046
01:23:25,882 --> 01:23:27,817
Thank you for being on time.

1047
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,221
Carol the waitress.
Simon the fag.

1048
01:23:38,766 --> 01:23:41,530
Hello.
Holy God! Who did that to you?

1049
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:47,135
Um, I was attacked.

1050
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:49,644
I walked in on some men robbing me...

1051
01:23:49,712 --> 01:23:52,705
and I was hospitalized.

1052
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:58,018
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

1053
01:23:58,089 --> 01:24:00,025
Let's go.

1054
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:04,389
How are you, sir?
Oh, I was gonna do that for you.

1055
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:06,592
It's all right.
Where should we sit?

1056
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:09,934
I, uh... Well, there's
no place cards or anything.

1057
01:24:10,005 --> 01:24:14,442
You look like you need more room,
so I'll sit in the back.

1058
01:24:29,396 --> 01:24:32,729
Never a break. Never.

1059
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,736
Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

1060
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:40,472
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

1061
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:44,814
Thanks.

1062
01:24:53,894 --> 01:24:55,759
Thank you.

1063
01:24:57,332 --> 01:24:59,266
You're welcome.

1064
01:25:03,173 --> 01:25:06,267
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1065
01:25:10,783 --> 01:25:14,310
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1066
01:25:16,022 --> 01:25:18,184
Seriously.

1067
01:25:18,259 --> 01:25:20,921
We got good stuff here.

1068
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:36,476
When it's not always raining
There'll be days like this

1069
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:39,279
- When there's no complaining
- I like this music.

1070
01:25:39,352 --> 01:25:41,513
There'll be days like this

1071
01:25:41,588 --> 01:25:44,148
I like this music.

1072
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:46,920
Like the flick of a switch

1073
01:25:46,995 --> 01:25:49,520
Well, my mama told me

1074
01:25:49,598 --> 01:25:52,897
There'll be days like this

1075
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:58,569
Well, I'm looking for my girl
I wonder where can she be

1076
01:25:58,644 --> 01:26:02,808
Simon, I'm sure they did something
really off for you to feel this way...

1077
01:26:02,881 --> 01:26:06,284
but when it comes to your parents
or your kid...

1078
01:26:06,353 --> 01:26:10,757
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

1079
01:26:10,826 --> 01:26:15,594
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

1080
01:26:15,665 --> 01:26:18,600
Nonsense.
And you want to know why?

1081
01:26:18,669 --> 01:26:21,605
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

1082
01:26:31,285 --> 01:26:34,151
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?

1083
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:35,952
Yes.

1084
01:26:37,027 --> 01:26:38,790
- When I was a kid...
- No, wait.

1085
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:41,728
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

1086
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:50,535
Well, I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

1087
01:26:50,609 --> 01:26:54,740
I mean, she was really
sort of fabulous about it, actually.

1088
01:26:54,815 --> 01:26:57,909
And she used to...

1089
01:26:57,985 --> 01:27:01,615
I was too young to think
that there was anything wrong with it.

1090
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:06,924
She was very natural,
so she used to pose nude for me.

1091
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,128
And I always thought,
or I guess I assumed...

1092
01:27:11,202 --> 01:27:13,261
that my father knew about it.

1093
01:27:13,338 --> 01:27:15,170
This stuff is pointless.

1094
01:27:15,241 --> 01:27:18,836
- Hey, let him finish...
- You like sad stories? Wanna hear mine?

1095
01:27:18,912 --> 01:27:20,072
Stop.

1096
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:26,982
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

1097
01:27:28,924 --> 01:27:34,591
One day he walked in and found us,
and he started screaming.

1098
01:27:34,665 --> 01:27:37,430
My father didn't come out of his room
for 1 1 years.

1099
01:27:37,501 --> 01:27:40,528
He used to hit me on the hands
with a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1100
01:27:40,607 --> 01:27:42,471
playing the piano.

1101
01:27:46,615 --> 01:27:48,047
Go ahead, Simon.

1102
01:27:48,116 --> 01:27:51,644
So you said he came in your room
and he was yelling?

1103
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,348
- Uh-huh.
- Please, come on.

1104
01:27:56,493 --> 01:27:59,462
- He was, um...
- Come on.

1105
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,397
Yeah, I know. I was...

1106
01:28:02,468 --> 01:28:04,902
I remember I was defending
my mother...

1107
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:07,598
and I was trying to, you know...

1108
01:28:07,673 --> 01:28:10,871
make peace in the lamest way.

1109
01:28:10,945 --> 01:28:13,470
I said...

1110
01:28:13,548 --> 01:28:16,039
"She's not naked. It's art."

1111
01:28:19,055 --> 01:28:20,750
He started hitting me...

1112
01:28:22,325 --> 01:28:26,126
and he beat me unconscious.

1113
01:28:26,198 --> 01:28:29,497
And he talked to me
less and less after that.

1114
01:28:29,568 --> 01:28:32,731
I mean, he knew what I was
before I did.

1115
01:28:32,805 --> 01:28:36,366
And the morning
that I left for college...

1116
01:28:36,443 --> 01:28:38,378
he walked into my room...

1117
01:28:38,445 --> 01:28:41,415
and he held out his hand...

1118
01:28:41,484 --> 01:28:44,248
and it was filled with money.

1119
01:28:45,489 --> 01:28:49,859
A big, sweaty wad of money.

1120
01:28:51,864 --> 01:28:55,698
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1121
01:28:57,205 --> 01:29:01,300
And I just grabbed him
and I hugged him...

1122
01:29:01,374 --> 01:29:03,970
and he turned and walked out.

1123
01:29:16,293 --> 01:29:19,627
We all have these terrible stories
to get over, and you...

1124
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,223
That's not true.

1125
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,098
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories...

1126
01:29:24,171 --> 01:29:26,298
that take place at lakes...

1127
01:29:26,373 --> 01:29:30,276
with boats and friends
and noodle salad.

1128
01:29:30,346 --> 01:29:32,280
just no one in this car.

1129
01:29:32,348 --> 01:29:33,975
But a lot of people...

1130
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:37,919
that's their story:
good times, noodle salad.

1131
01:29:37,989 --> 01:29:42,016
What makes it so hard
is not that you had it bad...

1132
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:45,793
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

1133
01:29:45,866 --> 01:29:50,166
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1134
01:29:51,706 --> 01:29:53,138
Not it at all, huh?

1135
01:29:57,113 --> 01:30:00,914
Let's go to the hotel.

1136
01:30:00,985 --> 01:30:03,647
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get
another big wad...

1137
01:30:03,721 --> 01:30:05,985
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1138
01:30:15,337 --> 01:30:17,861
Can I ask you a personal question?

1139
01:30:20,842 --> 01:30:22,401
Sure.

1140
01:30:23,814 --> 01:30:25,748
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

1141
01:30:29,454 --> 01:30:32,912
I mean, wouldn't your life
be easier if you weren't...

1142
01:30:32,992 --> 01:30:35,084
You consider your life easy?

1143
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:40,065
All right.
I give you that one.

1144
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,205
Nice packin'.

1145
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,280
- Hey, Spence.
- Hi, Mom,

1146
01:30:58,091 --> 01:31:00,856
- Wait till you hear,
- Why are you out of breath?

1147
01:31:00,928 --> 01:31:03,988
Mom, I ran over a guy
and scored a goal,

1148
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:08,057
- You did?
- yeah, He was big, Charlie, you know,

1149
01:31:08,136 --> 01:31:10,503
That's great!

1150
01:31:10,574 --> 01:31:13,542
- yep, Amazing,
- Oh, my God, right?

1151
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:16,306
Mom, we're playing again,
Gotta go, Bye,

1152
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:18,440
Wait.Just tell me...

1153
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:24,489
- He scored a goal,
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1154
01:31:24,557 --> 01:31:26,718
- Oh, you would've died.
- Oh, my God,!

1155
01:31:28,561 --> 01:31:33,500
My son was outside playing soccer.
Come on.

1156
01:31:33,568 --> 01:31:36,731
Take me out for a good time.
Take me out dancing.

1157
01:31:36,806 --> 01:31:37,932
Dancing?

1158
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,670
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1159
01:31:41,745 --> 01:31:44,578
Oh, come on. Please, come on.

1160
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,576
All right.

1161
01:31:48,654 --> 01:31:50,815
You're right.

1162
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:55,829
- Are you sad or something?
- No, I'm nervous.

1163
01:31:55,898 --> 01:31:59,766
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1164
01:31:59,835 --> 01:32:01,598
What a nice compliment.

1165
01:32:14,888 --> 01:32:16,047
I'm happy.

1166
01:32:17,724 --> 01:32:19,783
And you're my date.

1167
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:23,053
Let's get dressed.

1168
01:32:32,343 --> 01:32:34,777
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1169
01:32:34,847 --> 01:32:37,338
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1170
01:33:15,265 --> 01:33:18,063
- All set?
- Yeah.

1171
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,700
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1172
01:33:24,776 --> 01:33:27,574
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1173
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:39,187
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1174
01:33:40,564 --> 01:33:42,554
Thank you.

1175
01:33:42,632 --> 01:33:44,293
Good evening.

1176
01:33:44,367 --> 01:33:47,531
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1177
01:33:47,606 --> 01:33:50,938
just him. Okay, you can answer.
We worked it out.

1178
01:33:51,009 --> 01:33:52,500
Yes, we do.

1179
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:55,571
Oh, and I can give you
a tie and jacket.

1180
01:33:55,649 --> 01:33:58,618
- What?
- They require a tie and jacket.

1181
01:33:58,687 --> 01:34:00,119
We have some available.

1182
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:16,040
No, I'm not putting that on.

1183
01:34:17,043 --> 01:34:21,173
I'm also not going to let you inject me
with the plague, either.

1184
01:34:21,248 --> 01:34:23,547
It's such a nice place.

1185
01:34:23,619 --> 01:34:26,110
You probably have these dry cleaned
all the time, don't you?

1186
01:34:26,188 --> 01:34:28,019
Actually, I don't think so.

1187
01:34:36,133 --> 01:34:40,127
Well, you just wait here.

1188
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:43,007
Excuse me.

1189
01:34:54,992 --> 01:34:56,926
Good evening.

1190
01:34:58,863 --> 01:35:01,855
- I need a coat and tie.
- Well, come on in.

1191
01:35:05,938 --> 01:35:09,101
- Uh, that one.
- This one?

1192
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:11,906
That one, yeah.
And this tie.

1193
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:22,920
Excuse me.

1194
01:35:26,865 --> 01:35:30,767
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

1195
01:35:30,837 --> 01:35:34,501
- Thanks.
- Should I get her for you?

1196
01:35:34,575 --> 01:35:37,806
No, that's all right.
I'll just watch.

1197
01:35:43,519 --> 01:35:47,421
- Can I buy you another drink?
- This is plenty. No, thank you.

1198
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:32,878
Oh. Wait.

1199
01:37:03,822 --> 01:37:06,382
You look so se...

1200
01:37:08,394 --> 01:37:10,885
You look, uh, great.

1201
01:37:13,266 --> 01:37:14,756
You look great.

1202
01:37:25,216 --> 01:37:26,706
You want to dance?

1203
01:37:28,353 --> 01:37:31,653
Well, I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1204
01:37:31,724 --> 01:37:33,782
- And?
- No.

1205
01:37:36,096 --> 01:37:38,588
I don't get this place.

1206
01:37:39,868 --> 01:37:43,566
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

1207
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,201
I don't get it.

1208
01:37:47,277 --> 01:37:49,801
What? No. Wait. Why?

1209
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,941
Where are you goin'? Why?

1210
01:37:55,988 --> 01:37:59,686
I didn't mean it that way.
You ought to sit down.

1211
01:37:59,759 --> 01:38:02,957
You can still give me the dirty look.
just sit down and give it to me.

1212
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,259
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1213
01:38:05,332 --> 01:38:08,426
I need one. Quick.

1214
01:38:08,503 --> 01:38:11,940
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1215
01:38:12,009 --> 01:38:15,341
The mono-minute someone gets
that they need you...

1216
01:38:15,412 --> 01:38:17,573
they threaten to walk out.

1217
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:20,743
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1218
01:38:22,388 --> 01:38:26,119
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1219
01:38:35,338 --> 01:38:36,771
And mean it.

1220
01:38:48,621 --> 01:38:50,055
Can we order first?

1221
01:38:57,967 --> 01:39:00,491
Two hard-shell crab dinners!

1222
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:02,298
Pitcher of ice-cold beer!

1223
01:39:02,372 --> 01:39:04,203
Baked or fries?

1224
01:39:04,275 --> 01:39:05,708
Fries.

1225
01:39:10,082 --> 01:39:12,381
One baked, one fried.

1226
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:15,147
I'll tell your waiter.

1227
01:39:15,221 --> 01:39:17,052
My waiter.

1228
01:39:17,124 --> 01:39:22,688
Okay, now, I got a real great
compliment for you...

1229
01:39:22,764 --> 01:39:24,891
and it's true.

1230
01:39:24,966 --> 01:39:27,094
I'm so afraid you're about
to say something awful.

1231
01:39:28,172 --> 01:39:30,732
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1232
01:39:31,976 --> 01:39:34,500
Okay, here I go.

1233
01:39:35,948 --> 01:39:38,109
Clearly a mistake.

1234
01:39:39,853 --> 01:39:44,223
I've got this, what, ailment?

1235
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:51,824
My doctor, a shrink that
I used to go to all the time...

1236
01:39:51,902 --> 01:39:54,666
says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases...

1237
01:39:54,738 --> 01:39:57,138
a pill really helps.

1238
01:39:58,209 --> 01:39:59,643
I hate pills.

1239
01:39:59,711 --> 01:40:01,975
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1240
01:40:02,048 --> 01:40:06,851
I'm using the word "hate" here
about pills.

1241
01:40:06,921 --> 01:40:09,889
My compliment is, that night...

1242
01:40:09,957 --> 01:40:13,415
when you came over and told me
that you would never...

1243
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:19,263
All right, well, you were there.
You know what you said.

1244
01:40:19,336 --> 01:40:21,896
Well, my compliment to you is...

1245
01:40:23,209 --> 01:40:27,771
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1246
01:40:31,452 --> 01:40:34,114
I don't quite get
how that's a compliment for me.

1247
01:40:39,796 --> 01:40:42,356
You make me want to be a better man.

1248
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:58,309
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.

1249
01:41:03,526 --> 01:41:05,551
Well, maybe I overshot a little.

1250
01:41:05,628 --> 01:41:08,563
I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.

1251
01:41:21,048 --> 01:41:22,982
How's it goin' with those pills?

1252
01:41:24,519 --> 01:41:27,182
Good, I hope, I hope...

1253
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:34,263
It's little by little.

1254
01:41:37,536 --> 01:41:40,472
It's exhausting talking like this.

1255
01:42:01,098 --> 01:42:04,431
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1256
01:42:05,972 --> 01:42:07,064
Never.

1257
01:42:08,575 --> 01:42:11,203
Here's the trouble with "never."

1258
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,706
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1259
01:42:39,147 --> 01:42:42,082
When you first came in to breakfast,
when I first saw you...

1260
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:43,641
I thought you were handsome.

1261
01:42:45,756 --> 01:42:47,690
Then, of course, you spoke.

1262
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:54,262
So now that your...

1263
01:42:54,333 --> 01:42:56,597
soft little underbelly
is all exposed...

1264
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:59,764
tell me, why did you
bring me here?

1265
01:43:06,249 --> 01:43:07,682
It's...

1266
01:43:11,621 --> 01:43:13,555
a personal question.

1267
01:43:13,624 --> 01:43:17,026
- Tell me, even if you're scared.
- Scared?

1268
01:43:17,095 --> 01:43:19,393
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1269
01:43:21,367 --> 01:43:22,892
It's okay.

1270
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:25,905
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1271
01:43:27,207 --> 01:43:29,699
Well, I...

1272
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:33,512
I don't know.

1273
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:36,278
There's a lot of reasons.

1274
01:43:36,353 --> 01:43:39,755
I thought... one thought...
maybe if you had sex with Simon...

1275
01:43:39,824 --> 01:43:41,485
What?

1276
01:43:43,662 --> 01:43:46,325
Well, that's just one idea.

1277
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:48,264
That's why you brought me?

1278
01:43:48,336 --> 01:43:51,133
Like I'm a what...

1279
01:43:51,205 --> 01:43:53,902
and I owe you what?

1280
01:43:53,976 --> 01:43:56,409
I don't know why I brought you.

1281
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,042
That was just one thought that I had.
It came out first. That's all it was.

1282
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:03,450
I thought, you kiss him, me.

1283
01:44:03,521 --> 01:44:06,456
When you two seemed to hit it off...

1284
01:44:06,525 --> 01:44:08,721
No, wait. That's... I didn't mean...

1285
01:44:08,795 --> 01:44:11,058
Forget what I said about Simon.

1286
01:44:11,131 --> 01:44:14,067
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1287
01:44:15,803 --> 01:44:17,430
It was a mistake.

1288
01:44:23,913 --> 01:44:26,245
- Hello, this is Fred Bishop,
-And Betty,

1289
01:44:26,317 --> 01:44:28,581
We're sorry to be unable
to take your call right now,

1290
01:44:28,653 --> 01:44:31,019
Please leave a message
with all the pertinent information,

1291
01:44:31,089 --> 01:44:32,853
-Say good-bye,
- Good-bye,

1292
01:44:32,925 --> 01:44:34,654
Thank you,

1293
01:44:34,728 --> 01:44:36,662
It's Simon.

1294
01:44:38,232 --> 01:44:40,167
I'm in town.

1295
01:44:45,307 --> 01:44:48,436
Folks, you haven't been out later
that 1 0:00 in your entire lives.

1296
01:44:48,512 --> 01:44:50,913
Please pick up the phone.

1297
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:54,851
Really.

1298
01:44:59,692 --> 01:45:01,717
I'll try you in the morning.

1299
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:04,094
I need to see you...

1300
01:45:04,165 --> 01:45:07,430
or at least get you
to answer the phone.

1301
01:45:16,014 --> 01:45:18,881
How are you?

1302
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,282
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room.

1303
01:45:21,353 --> 01:45:24,447
I don't wanna see him,
and he's not gonna knock on your door.

1304
01:45:24,523 --> 01:45:25,615
What happened?

1305
01:45:26,827 --> 01:45:28,762
Don't ask.

1306
01:45:31,332 --> 01:45:34,268
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1307
01:45:34,337 --> 01:45:36,635
- Do you need help...
- No!

1308
01:45:38,876 --> 01:45:42,142
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1309
01:45:42,214 --> 01:45:43,407
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1310
01:45:45,785 --> 01:45:49,152
I'm tired of my own complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1311
01:45:49,222 --> 01:45:50,849
What are you thinking about?

1312
01:45:52,392 --> 01:45:53,757
How to die, mostly.

1313
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:59,063
Can you believe, in our little mix,
you're the good roommate?

1314
01:46:12,718 --> 01:46:15,210
- Good night.
- Good night.

1315
01:46:58,009 --> 01:46:59,943
Hold it.

1316
01:47:19,937 --> 01:47:23,030
- I have to draw you.
- Huh?

1317
01:47:24,877 --> 01:47:26,674
I have to draw you.

1318
01:47:28,848 --> 01:47:31,443
Absolutely not. I'm a lot
more shy than people think.

1319
01:47:31,518 --> 01:47:33,543
- I give off the wrong impression.
- I have to.

1320
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:35,487
I haven't sketched anything
in weeks.

1321
01:47:35,558 --> 01:47:38,322
Stop staring.
Do a vase.

1322
01:47:39,629 --> 01:47:40,721
But you're beautiful.

1323
01:47:40,797 --> 01:47:43,630
Your skin, your long neck...

1324
01:47:45,068 --> 01:47:47,799
the back, the line of you.

1325
01:47:49,943 --> 01:47:52,809
You're why cavemen
chiseled on walls.

1326
01:47:56,417 --> 01:47:57,907
All right. Cut me a break.

1327
01:48:21,481 --> 01:48:23,506
The next thing I know she's...

1328
01:48:23,584 --> 01:48:26,748
sitting right there next to me.

1329
01:48:26,822 --> 01:48:29,484
Well, it's not right
to go into details.

1330
01:48:29,559 --> 01:48:32,119
I got nervous.

1331
01:48:32,195 --> 01:48:34,858
I screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1332
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,495
Where if I hadn't...

1333
01:48:40,572 --> 01:48:44,009
I could be in bed right now
with a woman...

1334
01:48:44,078 --> 01:48:48,845
who if you make her laugh,
you got a life.

1335
01:48:51,387 --> 01:48:54,288
Instead, I'm here with you.

1336
01:48:54,357 --> 01:48:57,986
No offense, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1337
01:49:02,935 --> 01:49:04,870
jameson, soda back.

1338
01:49:07,407 --> 01:49:09,602
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1339
01:49:09,676 --> 01:49:13,738
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No.

1340
01:49:13,816 --> 01:49:17,013
This is great.
This is so great.

1341
01:49:17,086 --> 01:49:20,214
I swear to God,
my hand won't even keep up.

1342
01:49:20,289 --> 01:49:22,554
- Hold it.
- I'm just turning.

1343
01:49:22,626 --> 01:49:25,424
- Then hold that. Hold any of them.
- Okay. This?

1344
01:49:25,497 --> 01:49:29,264
It doesn't matter.
My hand's not even bothering me.

1345
01:49:29,335 --> 01:49:32,327
I can't... I just...

1346
01:49:32,405 --> 01:49:35,431
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

1347
01:49:39,681 --> 01:49:41,615
Oh, careful.

1348
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:55,794
Coming in. It's late.

1349
01:50:02,377 --> 01:50:04,039
Did you have sex with her?

1350
01:50:04,947 --> 01:50:06,914
You're sure you
don't want your shampoos?

1351
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:14,514
Sorry.

1352
01:50:14,592 --> 01:50:17,721
I didn't know
she was still here.

1353
01:50:17,796 --> 01:50:20,822
- Did you have sex with her?
- To hell with sex.

1354
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:23,392
It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1355
01:50:24,905 --> 01:50:28,363
What I need
he gave me great.

1356
01:50:28,443 --> 01:50:31,436
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1357
01:50:36,353 --> 01:50:38,287
I just love her.

1358
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:46,365
How are you doin'?

1359
01:51:02,254 --> 01:51:04,745
- Hello?
- Mom? Hi.

1360
01:51:04,789 --> 01:51:08,349
Hello, Simon, you were right,
We were home last night,

1361
01:51:08,427 --> 01:51:10,452
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1362
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:13,225
- I'm not a screamer,
- No, no.

1363
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,996
It was the luckiest thing
you didn't answer last night.

1364
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:18,198
- your father hasn't been feeling well,
- I can't hear you.

1365
01:51:18,274 --> 01:51:21,175
- It's too late to start, Hold on,
- Hold for what?

1366
01:51:21,243 --> 01:51:23,609
What are you gonna do?
Where are you going?

1367
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:26,582
I get why you're angry with me,
but it's no snap to...

1368
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:29,642
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1369
01:51:29,721 --> 01:51:32,849
Truly no grudges, okay?
Truly.

1370
01:51:32,926 --> 01:51:37,192
It was odd that you didn't come see me
when you heard I was hurt, but...

1371
01:51:37,264 --> 01:51:40,700
- We almost did,
- I don't even want to talk about it.

1372
01:51:40,769 --> 01:51:43,829
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

1373
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:46,999
- you do sound different,
- Yes, I'm working again.

1374
01:51:47,076 --> 01:51:50,377
- Good, About money...
- I don't need anything.

1375
01:51:50,447 --> 01:51:52,938
I'll drop you a line
from wherever I land.

1376
01:51:53,017 --> 01:51:56,043
Then it's up to you to make
the next move, and I hope you do.

1377
01:51:56,121 --> 01:51:58,147
He's gonna want to stay.

1378
01:51:58,224 --> 01:52:01,853
They'll want to take a ride
to the lake or whatever.

1379
01:52:01,929 --> 01:52:04,956
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye, dear,

1380
01:52:05,033 --> 01:52:08,059
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- Bye, Mom.

1381
01:52:08,136 --> 01:52:10,467
We'll probably have
a good five-hour drive.

1382
01:52:10,539 --> 01:52:13,236
- It'll give us a chance to relax...
- So?

1383
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:15,801
- and be together alone.
- I'm coming with you.

1384
01:52:16,714 --> 01:52:19,707
- What about your parents?
- No, I'll take care of myself.

1385
01:52:19,785 --> 01:52:23,551
What are you talking about?
You got real problems.

1386
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:27,824
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1387
01:52:27,895 --> 01:52:31,729
Suddenly everything
seems so easy.

1388
01:52:31,799 --> 01:52:34,927
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1389
01:52:37,607 --> 01:52:40,838
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1390
01:52:42,513 --> 01:52:46,746
- Ah, geez. No choice.
- I got a gift for you.

1391
01:52:46,818 --> 01:52:50,516
Nothing like no choice
to make you feel at home.

1392
01:52:50,591 --> 01:52:52,787
Let me see.

1393
01:52:52,861 --> 01:52:55,294
Ah. Gorgeous.

1394
01:52:55,363 --> 01:53:00,267
Do it then, and pick up the dog.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1395
01:53:00,337 --> 01:53:01,769
Good-bye.

1396
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,603
Your luck's running.

1397
01:53:05,675 --> 01:53:09,272
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1398
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:14,651
Frank's got a line on another place
you can use for now.

1399
01:53:14,722 --> 01:53:18,249
- Another place where?
- Does it matter?

1400
01:53:22,899 --> 01:53:25,059
It doesn't.

1401
01:53:25,969 --> 01:53:28,334
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1402
01:53:30,308 --> 01:53:31,969
I'm sorry.

1403
01:53:55,474 --> 01:53:59,001
I love you

1404
01:54:01,748 --> 01:54:04,308
For sentimental reasons

1405
01:54:04,384 --> 01:54:06,944
I don't want to hear
that music right now.

1406
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:10,012
- You said you liked it.
- I don't.

1407
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:15,830
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your call...

1408
01:54:15,898 --> 01:54:18,800
but I don't want to hear it,
if that means anything.

1409
01:54:38,561 --> 01:54:40,893
Yes, sir. All right.

1410
01:54:40,964 --> 01:54:45,230
Here's the keys
to my apartment.

1411
01:54:45,303 --> 01:54:49,673
You go up there and wait.
I'm gonna take Carol home.

1412
01:54:50,609 --> 01:54:53,100
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

1413
01:54:59,721 --> 01:55:02,349
Can you come here?

1414
01:55:02,424 --> 01:55:05,360
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1415
01:55:06,663 --> 01:55:09,154
I don't think
I want to know you anymore.

1416
01:55:09,233 --> 01:55:11,929
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1417
01:55:15,508 --> 01:55:17,442
You have my number.

1418
01:55:19,947 --> 01:55:22,040
Let him take you home.

1419
01:55:22,116 --> 01:55:24,051
I don't want to.

1420
01:55:25,154 --> 01:55:28,352
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1421
01:55:38,203 --> 01:55:40,137
Don't say anything.

1422
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:46,910
I gotta get ahold of Frank,
see where I'm hanging my hat.

1423
01:55:46,982 --> 01:55:49,313
Well...

1424
01:55:49,384 --> 01:55:52,149
I think you're gonna
have to camp it here.

1425
01:55:52,221 --> 01:55:55,282
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, look! There's Verdell!

1426
01:55:55,359 --> 01:55:56,689
Look at you!

1427
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,819
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1428
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:07,431
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1429
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:12,936
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1430
01:56:15,417 --> 01:56:20,548
They rented your place furnished.
jackie brought your personal things.

1431
01:56:20,623 --> 01:56:24,060
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room.

1432
01:56:24,129 --> 01:56:26,063
I never use it.

1433
01:56:26,131 --> 01:56:29,157
It's got good light.
No other choice, really.

1434
01:56:29,235 --> 01:56:31,169
I'm coming.

1435
01:56:33,373 --> 01:56:37,868
It's nice.

1436
01:56:37,946 --> 01:56:40,039
It looks good.

1437
01:56:41,417 --> 01:56:44,352
They got your music...

1438
01:56:44,421 --> 01:56:46,982
paintings, paints.

1439
01:56:47,058 --> 01:56:49,253
Have to say
they did a good job.

1440
01:56:52,564 --> 01:56:55,159
Well, it's gonna be okay, huh?

1441
01:56:55,234 --> 01:56:58,225
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1442
01:57:03,946 --> 01:57:05,037
Thank you.

1443
01:57:07,282 --> 01:57:08,773
You overwhelm me.

1444
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,259
I love you.

1445
01:57:23,838 --> 01:57:26,272
I tell you, buddy.

1446
01:57:26,341 --> 01:57:29,777
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1447
01:57:42,661 --> 01:57:44,891
Make yourself at home.

1448
01:57:47,133 --> 01:57:50,501
Anything else in the bag?

1449
01:57:50,571 --> 01:57:54,200
- I played soccer while you were away.
- Yeah, I know.

1450
01:57:54,276 --> 01:57:57,735
I love my cookbook.

1451
01:57:57,814 --> 01:58:01,181
It's great. It's got all
these wonderful recipes in here.

1452
01:58:01,252 --> 01:58:04,780
It says something for shark.
I never fixed shark before.

1453
01:58:04,856 --> 01:58:08,314
"Shark With A Bite."
Would you like that, Spencer?

1454
01:58:08,393 --> 01:58:11,420
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' Nest."

1455
01:58:14,736 --> 01:58:18,263
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1456
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:20,832
Where is he?

1457
01:58:20,911 --> 01:58:24,312
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart.

1458
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:27,947
Oh, you're in bed.

1459
01:58:28,019 --> 01:58:29,782
Oh, no.

1460
01:58:30,788 --> 01:58:32,449
Yeah.

1461
01:58:34,427 --> 01:58:38,727
I just didn't think Verdell
should get too comfortable...

1462
01:58:38,799 --> 01:58:40,734
- sleeping in here.
- Look.

1463
01:58:40,801 --> 01:58:43,362
- It's not gonna...
- The dog's already comfortable.

1464
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:48,640
Is this okay?

1465
01:58:53,451 --> 01:58:55,248
It's me. Hi!

1466
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,083
Yes.

1467
01:58:57,155 --> 01:59:00,887
He took me in. Yes.
It's Carol for you.

1468
01:59:00,961 --> 01:59:04,158
I practically fainted
when I walked in.

1469
01:59:04,232 --> 01:59:06,326
- Take the dog.
- I gotta go.

1470
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:10,497
-Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1471
01:59:12,174 --> 01:59:14,302
Come on. Move faster.

1472
01:59:14,379 --> 01:59:18,405
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1473
01:59:32,401 --> 01:59:35,494
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

1474
01:59:35,572 --> 01:59:40,134
- Not so hot.
- Why? What's wrong?

1475
01:59:40,211 --> 01:59:43,373
I don't know whether I'm
being sensible or hard on you.

1476
01:59:43,447 --> 01:59:45,541
Maybe both, Maybe,

1477
01:59:45,618 --> 01:59:49,748
See, right there, I don't know
whether you're being cute or crazy.

1478
01:59:49,822 --> 01:59:52,951
- Cute.
- Don't answer everything I say.

1479
01:59:53,027 --> 01:59:56,485
just listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

1480
01:59:57,967 --> 02:00:02,233
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1481
02:00:02,305 --> 02:00:05,366
And what I said on the street...

1482
02:00:05,442 --> 02:00:07,843
that was a bad thing to say.

1483
02:00:07,913 --> 02:00:12,248
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1484
02:00:14,788 --> 02:00:19,521
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1485
02:00:21,096 --> 02:00:24,328
But the truth is,
you do bother me enormously.

1486
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,995
And I know that it...

1487
02:00:27,071 --> 02:00:29,800
I think that it's better for me
to not have contact with you...

1488
02:00:29,872 --> 02:00:31,534
because you're not ready...

1489
02:00:31,611 --> 02:00:33,840
and you're a pretty old guy
to not be ready...

1490
02:00:33,913 --> 02:00:36,540
and I'm too old to ignore that.

1491
02:00:36,616 --> 02:00:39,881
But there were
extraordinary kindnesses...

1492
02:00:39,953 --> 02:00:41,887
that did take place.

1493
02:00:49,865 --> 02:00:51,492
Anyway, thanks for the trip.

1494
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:56,496
Good night.

1495
02:00:56,575 --> 02:00:58,338
Okay if I say something now?

1496
02:01:03,484 --> 02:01:04,576
Go ahead.

1497
02:01:07,188 --> 02:01:09,315
I should have danced with you.

1498
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:16,264
Good night.

1499
02:01:37,393 --> 02:01:41,262
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1500
02:01:52,512 --> 02:01:55,879
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1501
02:01:55,949 --> 02:01:57,644
Extraordinary.

1502
02:01:57,719 --> 02:02:01,086
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1503
02:02:03,092 --> 02:02:05,027
I'm dying here.

1504
02:02:07,264 --> 02:02:09,528
Because...

1505
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,692
you love her.

1506
02:02:13,371 --> 02:02:16,738
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1507
02:02:16,809 --> 02:02:19,778
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here."

1508
02:02:21,215 --> 02:02:22,307
I don't know.

1509
02:02:22,383 --> 02:02:25,147
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1510
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:28,588
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1511
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:33,389
I'm stuck.

1512
02:02:33,463 --> 02:02:36,763
I can't get back
to my old life.

1513
02:02:39,004 --> 02:02:41,199
She's evicted me from my life.

1514
02:02:41,274 --> 02:02:43,208
Did you really like it that much?

1515
02:02:43,276 --> 02:02:45,939
Well, it's better than this.

1516
02:02:46,013 --> 02:02:48,846
Look, you,
I'm very intelligent.

1517
02:02:48,917 --> 02:02:51,887
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1518
02:02:51,954 --> 02:02:55,981
If you can't be at least mildly
interesting, then shut the hell up.

1519
02:02:56,058 --> 02:03:00,190
I'm drowning here,
and you're describing the water!

1520
02:03:00,266 --> 02:03:01,789
Picking on me won't help.

1521
02:03:04,403 --> 02:03:06,701
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1522
02:03:10,077 --> 02:03:12,671
Melvin, do you know
where you're lucky?

1523
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:18,847
You know who you want.

1524
02:03:21,224 --> 02:03:24,251
I would take your seat
any day.

1525
02:03:24,329 --> 02:03:26,490
So do something about it.

1526
02:03:26,565 --> 02:03:29,227
Go over there now, tonight.
Don't sleep on it.

1527
02:03:29,302 --> 02:03:32,795
It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1528
02:03:32,873 --> 02:03:35,774
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this.

1529
02:03:35,844 --> 02:03:39,246
Pull the stops.
Tell her how you feel.

1530
02:03:39,315 --> 02:03:43,081
- You can do this.
- Hey, I'm charged here.

1531
02:03:43,152 --> 02:03:46,520
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go over.

1532
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:49,492
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story.

1533
02:03:49,561 --> 02:03:51,619
I really think
you have a chance here.

1534
02:03:51,697 --> 02:03:55,567
The best thing you have going for you
is a willingness to humiliate yourself.

1535
02:03:55,635 --> 02:03:59,037
So go over there, do this.
Catch her off guard.

1536
02:04:04,646 --> 02:04:06,581
- Okay.
- Okay.

1537
02:04:09,085 --> 02:04:11,520
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1538
02:04:13,524 --> 02:04:15,458
Here I go.

1539
02:04:24,305 --> 02:04:26,069
What's wrong?

1540
02:04:29,645 --> 02:04:31,340
I forgot to lock the door.

1541
02:05:50,513 --> 02:05:52,448
What do you want, Melvin?

1542
02:05:53,585 --> 02:05:56,611
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

1543
02:06:01,562 --> 02:06:03,358
What a break.

1544
02:06:05,566 --> 02:06:08,400
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1545
02:06:11,841 --> 02:06:13,273
I had to see you.

1546
02:06:17,516 --> 02:06:18,608
Because?

1547
02:06:22,221 --> 02:06:24,985
It relaxes me.

1548
02:06:26,727 --> 02:06:30,926
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb...

1549
02:06:30,999 --> 02:06:32,261
than any other place...

1550
02:06:32,334 --> 02:06:35,666
I can think of or imagine.

1551
02:06:35,738 --> 02:06:38,469
No, wait.
That's overstating.

1552
02:06:38,542 --> 02:06:42,240
I'd rather be sitting inside
on the steps...

1553
02:06:42,313 --> 02:06:44,507
'cause I don't want to
get my feet in the gutter.

1554
02:06:44,583 --> 02:06:46,141
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1555
02:06:46,219 --> 02:06:49,814
Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1556
02:06:49,889 --> 02:06:53,553
just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1557
02:06:53,628 --> 02:06:57,689
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1558
02:07:00,904 --> 02:07:03,998
Oh, I'm sorry.

1559
02:07:04,074 --> 02:07:07,009
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1560
02:07:12,519 --> 02:07:14,042
Boyfriend.

1561
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:22,693
Come on in and try not
to ruin everything by being you.

1562
02:07:24,032 --> 02:07:26,900
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks.

1563
02:07:31,542 --> 02:07:33,477
Maybe we could.

1564
02:07:59,778 --> 02:08:03,214
It feels a little confined in here.

1565
02:08:03,284 --> 02:08:05,376
Let's take a walk.

1566
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:10,714
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.

1567
02:08:10,791 --> 02:08:14,353
A walk sounds
a little screwy to me...

1568
02:08:14,430 --> 02:08:15,920
if you don't mind.

1569
02:08:15,998 --> 02:08:20,436
Well, if you need an excuse...

1570
02:08:20,505 --> 02:08:24,271
there's a bakery on the corner
that will be open soon.

1571
02:08:24,342 --> 02:08:26,834
That way we're not screwy.

1572
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:30,873
just two people
that like warm rolls.

1573
02:08:35,157 --> 02:08:36,590
Okay.

1574
02:08:54,982 --> 02:08:57,314
What are you doing?

1575
02:08:57,384 --> 02:09:00,321
I still want you to hear
part of that car song.

1576
02:09:00,388 --> 02:09:02,323
You don't have to...

1577
02:09:08,933 --> 02:09:11,197
And darlin'

1578
02:09:11,269 --> 02:09:14,364
I'm never lonely

1579
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:18,432
Whenever you're in sight

1580
02:09:18,512 --> 02:09:20,446
Thank you.

1581
02:09:21,883 --> 02:09:23,817
You know, I was hoping...

1582
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:43,072
I'm sorry. Whatever this is
is not gonna work.

1583
02:09:52,422 --> 02:09:55,152
- I'm feel...
- What?

1584
02:09:57,227 --> 02:09:59,661
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1585
02:10:00,965 --> 02:10:04,493
Even though
it may seem that way now...

1586
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:07,664
you don't know me all that well.

1587
02:10:07,741 --> 02:10:09,232
I'm not the answer for you.

1588
02:10:09,310 --> 02:10:13,041
Hey, I've got
a great compliment for you.

1589
02:10:14,582 --> 02:10:17,882
- You know what?
-Just let me...

1590
02:10:17,954 --> 02:10:19,888
Let me talk.

1591
02:10:25,897 --> 02:10:29,628
I might be the only person
on the face of the Earth...

1592
02:10:29,701 --> 02:10:32,227
that knows you're
the greatest woman on Earth.

1593
02:10:32,306 --> 02:10:36,242
I might be the only one
who appreciates...

1594
02:10:36,311 --> 02:10:40,942
how amazing you are in every
single thing that you do...

1595
02:10:41,017 --> 02:10:43,917
and how you are with Spencer.

1596
02:10:43,986 --> 02:10:45,248
Spence.

1597
02:10:46,423 --> 02:10:50,258
In every single thought you have
and how you say what you mean...

1598
02:10:50,329 --> 02:10:52,889
and how you almost always
mean something...

1599
02:10:52,965 --> 02:10:57,562
that's all about
being straight and good.

1600
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:02,564
I think most people
miss that about you.

1601
02:11:02,644 --> 02:11:04,772
I wonder how they
can watch you...

1602
02:11:04,847 --> 02:11:07,838
bring their food
and clear their tables...

1603
02:11:07,917 --> 02:11:11,581
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1604
02:11:12,757 --> 02:11:14,951
And the fact that I get it...

1605
02:11:15,027 --> 02:11:16,961
makes me feel good...

1606
02:11:18,831 --> 02:11:20,355
about me.

1607
02:11:29,378 --> 02:11:32,143
Is that something that's...

1608
02:11:32,214 --> 02:11:34,649
bad for you to be around
for you?

1609
02:11:50,038 --> 02:11:51,300
I'm gonna grab ya.

1610
02:11:53,175 --> 02:11:56,008
I didn't mean for that
to be a question.

1611
02:11:56,078 --> 02:11:58,013
I'm gonna grab ya.

1612
02:12:21,577 --> 02:12:23,545
I know I can do better than that.

1613
02:12:47,877 --> 02:12:50,209
Better.
Definitely better.

1614
02:12:55,955 --> 02:12:57,048
See?

1615
02:13:14,999 --> 02:13:16,877
Warm rolls.

1616
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:28,116
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

1617
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:31,921
