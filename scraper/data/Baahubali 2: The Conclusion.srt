'If atonement for my
sins is what You seek...'

00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:14,650
'...take my life.'

'...this boy should live.'

00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:23,525
'He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him.'

7
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,984
'He should live to ascend
the throne Mahishmati.'

8

'Mahendra Baahubali should live.'

"Sacrifices..."

10
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:53,942
"Sacrifices..."

11
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,568
"and martyrs..."

"the flames of retribution!"

people awaited the occasion.'

the destruction of evil took place.'

Long live our beloved
Queen Shivgami Devi.

Long live Queen Mother Shivgami Devi.

Attack!

50
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,567
- Kattappa.
- Mother.

51
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:58,525
Escort everyone to a safe place.

52
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,317
But how can I abandon you?

53
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,067
It is my order, Kattappa.

54
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:03,276
Your wish is my command.

55
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:06,235
Soldiers, rush the people
to safe grounds.

56
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,151
Without faltering a single step.

57

"Your glory spreads far and wide."

58
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,485
"Long live Baahubali!"

59

"You're dearer to us than our lives."

"Everyone's going to sing..."

63
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,400
"and keep singing, in your praise!"

64
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,484
"He's like..."

65

"He's like..."

71
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,901
"an immovable mountain."

72
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:34,860
"Such a strong feeling of love."

73
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:41,443
"Such a strong bond."

74
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:51,568
"When one breathes,
the other feels alive."

75
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:59,401
"Bounded by the same bond."

76
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:05,692
"His stride's like the wind..."

77
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:09,318
"or like the raging fire."

78
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:13,943
"When he walks, the earth quivers."

79
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:17,443
"Such is Baahubali's might."

80
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:23,109
"Even death doesn't scare him..."

81
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,068
"because he's always
risking his life."

82
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:31,650
"For his mother's sake..."

83
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:36,150
"he can even lay down
his life in an instant."

84
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,359
"He's like..."

85
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,484
"an immovable mountain."

86
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,609
"He's like..."

87
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,859
"an immovable mountain."

88
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,985
"He's like..."

89
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,234
"like a bright shining star."

90
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:53,567
"an immovable mountain."

91
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,859
"He's like..."

92
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,109
"an immovable mountain."

93
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,150
"He's like..."

94
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,275
"an immovable mountain."

95
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:04,400
"He's like..."

96
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,610
"an immovable mountain."

97
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,192
"Your glory spreads far and wide."

98
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:11,484
"Long live Baahubali!"

99
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:15,401
"You're dearer to
us... than our lives."

100
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,984
"Your glory spreads far and wide."

101
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:20,192
"Long live Baahubali!"

102
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:23,943
"You're dearer to us than our lives."

103
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,235
"Everyone's going to sing..."

104
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,775
"and keep singing,
in your praise!"Baahubali!

105
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:43,776
Baahubali! Baahubali! Baahubali!

106
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:52,610
"Queen Mother!"

107
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:55,110
"Shivgami!"

108
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,735
Bhalla?

109
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,943
Have you ever thought of...

110
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:14,318
or wanted to kill your mother?

111
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:19,735
I wanted to do so.

112
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,984
Instead of nursing only you...

113
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,567
when you were a newborn...

114
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,567
she also nursed Baahubali.

115
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,192
That was the 1st time...

116
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,901
I wanted to kill her.

117
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:36,442
When she was sharing
the jewellery, fame...

118
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:40,901
rights, everything with him...

119
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,818
I wanted to kill her.

120
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:45,526
Now...

121
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:49,276
When she is bequeathing
the throne to him...

122
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,193
this hand is
trembling to strangle her.

123
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,985
Bhalla?

124
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,610
Shall we kill her?

125
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,651
You are talking
in a drunken stupor, father.

126
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:26,610
Your mother's watchdog is coming.

127
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,026
Hey! Bloody dog!

128
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:42,735
- My lord?
- What is your latest bark?

129
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:47,109
Her Majesty has decided
to crown Baahubali as king...

130
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,443
on forthcoming
'Vijaydashmi' festival.

131
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:54,360
Queen Mother wanted you to be
the 1st recipient of this news.

132
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:59,525
History repeats itself!

133
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:03,360
The throne meant for me
was given to my younger brother!

134
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:10,110
And now the throne meant for my son is
being bequeathed to my brother's son!

135
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:15,192
Should my son, grandson,
great-grandson also...

136
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:17,443
toil for generations?

137
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,901
Dog, answer!

138
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,276
Why was I not crowned as king then?

139
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,276
Was it because I am disabled?

140
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,234
So what if one hand
is incapacitated...

141
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,318
isn't my other iron
fist enough to rule our kingdom?

142
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:51,276
Kingship was denounced to you not
because of the disability of your hand...

143
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,235
but because of your
dysfunctional brain.

144
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,318
Command me, my lord.

145
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,610
Dog! Are you not
aware your razor tongue...

146
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:05,609
can be sliced into
2 for your insolence against a royal?

147
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,651
Forgive me, my lord.

148
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:09,360
The brain that wishes to
kill a beloved wife...

149
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,818
what else can it be
but deformed and devious?!

150
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:19,943
- Did you overhear?
- No, my lord.

151
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:21,900
Since I am a 'dog'...

152
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,401
I sniffed it!

153
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:48,360
She is the princess
of Pataliputra, Varuni.

154
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:52,609
In the entire country,
she is the most beautiful it seems.

155
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,610
But her eyes look lifeless.

156
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:57,817
She is not the right
choice for Baahubali.

157
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,068
- Look for another bride.
- Sure, Your Majesty.

158
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,360
Please keep this in mind, astrologer.

159
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,526
She will not only be
Baahubali's wife...

160
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:13,984
nut also the queen of this kingdom.

161
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,276
There should be no reason
to point a figure at her.

162
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,817
Mother, did you send for me?

163
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:22,650
Baahu, you must take
a tour of our kingdom.

164
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:23,900
As you wish, mother

165
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:27,275
Queen Mother, with the coronation
just around the corner...

166
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:30,026
taking a tour now
is not a good idea.

167
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,525
Even deities from our temples...

168
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:34,235
are taken on a procession.

169
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,943
Do you know why, minister?

170
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:40,401
So they can envision the gladness and
sadness of our subjects in person.

171
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:47,484
Baahu, only when the future king
steps outside the palace walls...

172
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,817
he can understand
the trials of his people.

173
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,192
- Yes, mother.
- Let Kattappa accompany you.

174
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,610
As you wish.

175
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:56,609
Mother, why take this old man along?

176
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,317
He will again bore me with the
same old stories.

177
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:01,901
Bear with him for one last time.

178
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,568
By the time you return...

179
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,567
I will find you a princess...

180
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,401
to narrate enchanting fairy tales!

181
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:47,525
- He is the thief.
- No, sir... I haven't done anything.

182
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,046
He has committed the theft.
Punish him.

183
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:58,942
Uncle, even at this
age you are so energetic?

184
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,025
You seem surprised about this.

185
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:03,525
The way I wielded a sword
when I was your age...

186
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:06,818
you know chaste maidens
would be dumbfounded?!

187
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:10,443
You are such a bragger, uncle.

188
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:19,485
Pindari (Bandits).

189
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,443
They don't just plunder
the entire kingdom.

190
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,818
In fact killing
people is their pastime.

191
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:37,860
I brought these wild elephants
specially for you to play with.

192
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:42,192
On the banks of
the river Pranahita...

193
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:44,860
is the Spring palace
I am building for you.

194
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,235
Do you like it, Bhalla?

195
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:56,485
I had this bow made in such a way
it can kill a target 50 miles away.

196
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,193
Mother...?

197
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,360
After giving the
throne to my brother...

198
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,401
are you compensating me
with these gifts?

199
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:11,776
Your son is not so petty to lament
about not being crowned as king, mother.

200
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:18,568
Queen Mother Shivgami Devi's
command will be complied.

201
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:22,235
Do not offer these gifts
and degrade their value.

202
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,235
- Taste this sweet, uncle.
- Thank you, dear.

203
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:54,235
Sir, who are you?

204
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,859
Good lord!

205
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,026
He is showing off like a hero?

206
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,150
Bandits...!

207
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,818
These are soldiers
in disguise to nab them.

208
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,595
We do not have
to strain ourselves.

209
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:15,025
She brandishes the sword
as fast as lightning.

210
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:16,443
Wonder who she...

211
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:24,693
By the way...

212
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:27,693
our hero seems to be
missing in action?

213
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,650
- My lord.
- Two of you go that side.

214
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,317
- Two this side.
- Yes, my lord.

215
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:38,943
10 of you stay right here.

216
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,818
Baahuu...!

217
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:08,568
Baahuu...!

218
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:12,776
Baahu, throw me the weapon.

219
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:15,485
Baahu...?

220
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:18,068
Baahu...?

221
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,525
What nonsense!
You are distracted, Baahu.

222
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:36,775
You chopped off a tree?

223
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,651
You know I escaped death
by a hair's breadth!

224
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,234
I might have died, you know?

225
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,525
I feel like I can
do anything for her.

226
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,692
Anything? Does it mean you can kill?

227
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:51,525
That too, kill me?!

228
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:56,901
Wretched fellow! I took such
good care of you in your childhood.

229
00:24:57,526 --> 00:25:00,860
You must do much more
to unite us, uncle.

230
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,692
- Madhav.
- Your Highness.

231
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:03,901
Trace their hideout.

232
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:07,525
- We must retrieve the stolen goods.
- Yes, Your Highness.

233
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:08,735
Tie all of them.

234
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:11,485
I will not let anyone escape.

235
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:14,484
Tie all of them properly.

236
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,067
Long live, Your Highness!

237
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:18,150
- You were a godsend.
- Thank you.

238
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:19,942
Saved us at the right time.

239
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:21,735
May you always be blessed.

240
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:23,735
You two seem fit as a fiddle.

241
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,443
Are you not ashamed
to hide behind women?

242
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,610
Forgive me, Your Highness.

243
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:34,651
My nephew is a bit of a numbskull.
He is not adept at any job.

244
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,193
- He was driven out of his house.
- What...?

245
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,485
- Your family threw you out?
- Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:42,360
You seem to be so compassionate.

247
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,942
If you can kindly
teach him some skill...

248
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,985
we will be grateful to you
until our last breath.

249
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,026
So be it.

250
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,651
He has a robust appearance.

251
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:54,192
If you train him in sword fighting
he can at least become a guard.

252
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:55,485
I will teach him that.

253
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:58,318
Grateful, sir.

254
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,985
Truly grateful, Your Highness.

255
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,610
Hey! Look over there.

256
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,734
'Full moon night is fast approaching.'

257
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:50,609
'We must pray to
Lord Krishna.'

258
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,484
'My queen,
it is purely a ladies' festival.'

259
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:55,776
'You perform it as you deem fit.'

260
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:06,526
Princess...

261
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:09,734
In our entire kingdom
no one can beat you in archery.

262
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:11,192
But still why are you not satisfied?

263
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:12,943
Not enough, Prime minister.

264
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,567
You cannot string 2 arrows
from 1 bow, Your Highness.

265
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:21,567
Prime minister, anything
is possible for my sister.

266
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:23,609
Try again, Devsena.

267
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,568
Move aside.

268
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,775
Instead of getting
your young sister married...

269
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:29,192
you are teaching her
all this like she is a boy.

270
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:31,025
Absolutely right, Your Majesty.

271
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,192
Will you choose from
the proposals in hand?

272
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,609
Or should I get you married
to my brother Kumar Varma?

273
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,235
Imbecile! Come along, I will show
our weapons to you.

274
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:40,360
This is a mace.

275
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,770
You won't be able to lift it.

276
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,110
This is a spear.

277
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:49,976
You won't be able to throw it.

278
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,276
This is a sword.

279
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:58,235
Come, I will teach you
how to wield it.

280
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:00,860
Tell me, what do you excel in?

281
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:02,442
Quite a few, my lord.

282
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,525
Outdoor games like 'Stick and stone',
Hide and seek.

283
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:06,067
'Tip-Cat'.

284
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,692
What about hopscotch?

285
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:08,734
I've watched from far.

286
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:10,860
But the girls don't let me play.

287
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,650
I will teach you
how to wield a sword.

288
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,026
Watch and learn.

289
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:17,610
You should hold like this.

290
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:20,860
- Lift it high.
- On!

291
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:22,693
Then one swift blow.

292
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:24,860
Try your hand.

293
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:30,318
Look how he's holding the sword.

294
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,651
You won't be able to do it, nephew.

295
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,943
Idiot! Let me show you once more.

296
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:38,318
Hold it like this.

297
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,526
Lift it above your head.

298
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,693
Like this.

299
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,401
Strike.

300
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,317
- What a blow, my lord.
- Did I?!

301
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:52,235
Of course, you.

302
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:54,026
Who else, my lord?

303
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
I did it.

304
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:01,068
Struck like a thunderbolt.

305
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,193
'Fantastic!'

306
00:29:03,194 --> 00:29:04,484
Elephant's might.

307
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:05,734
Lion's roar.

308
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:06,984
Cheetah's speed.

309
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:08,525
Vulture's sight.

310
00:29:08,526 --> 00:29:11,110
I can see the entire jungle
in you, my lord.

311
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,692
My lord?

312
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:15,984
- I like you.
- Grateful.

313
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,443
'I will teach you also
to wield the sword.'

314
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,692
Why this drama for a princess
of such a small kingdom?

315
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:29,359
Reveal your identity and they
will get you two married immediately.

316
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,485
What is this drama for?

317
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:33,484
A 60-year-old man wants
to know what love is.

318
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:37,026
How do I enlighten him?

319
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,943
Don't simply let
your tongue run, Baahu.

320
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:41,775
Describe love to me and if I still...

321
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,610
don't understand, then ridicule me.

322
00:29:51,318 --> 00:29:52,942
Look at those 2 partridges on...

323
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:54,818
that branch in this
cold wintry night.

324
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,110
The moon shining
in her full glory...

325
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:04,151
having their fill of the moonlight
scattered on the silken petals down there.

326
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:09,026
Watching them caress and feed
each other with affection.

327
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:11,776
What do you feel, uncle?

328
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,610
Having lived on this earth
for all these years...

329
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,984
I've never enjoyed them
anywhere, anytime.

330
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,568
If we catch these two,
marinate with salt and pepper...

331
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:26,860
roast them on a slow fire
simmer and eat them.

332
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:29,985
Sheer heaven!

333
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:48,859
What is wrong with you?

334
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,818
- You excelled this morning.
- My lord?

335
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:54,026
Princess Devsena is
coming to see you.

336
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,110
Welcome, Devsena.

337
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:05,525
If you should meet me
at this time of the night...

338
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:07,526
there must be a special reason.

339
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:08,818
Kumar...

340
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,568
I was unable to watch
your brave feat in the morning.

341
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,443
Please demonstrate now.

342
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:19,567
- Where can I get a log of wood now?
- It is right there.

343
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:20,860
Look at that.

344
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:25,235
It's hidden there.

345
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:28,818
You found it, huh?

346
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:30,901
Good you found this...

347
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,817
but where is my sword?

348
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:33,818
Over there.

349
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,776
Move a few steps back.

350
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,568
Go ahead.

351
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:50,401
Stop... stop, my lord.

352
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:52,984
If a brave warrior like you...

353
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:55,067
repeats the same feat at night...

354
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:57,276
it is considered a bad omen.

355
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:00,318
Are you not aware of this?

356
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,651
Why not?

357
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,401
I forgot.

358
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:05,693
You reminded me
at the right time.

359
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,318
- We intend to go hunting tomorrow.
- Why?

360
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:15,567
Wild pigs are ruining our field...

361
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,817
- Pigs disgust me.
- Not pigs.

362
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:19,234
- Wild boars.
- That too.

363
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:22,276
Farmers complained that these
boars are ravaging the fields.

364
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,317
Bring him also.

365
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:29,400
- Uncle!
- Well, even a rat will make him scurry.

366
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:31,067
Why do you want to
take him along?

367
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:33,068
How will he learn
if he is always in the kitchen?

368
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,035
If he accompanies us
only then we will know...

369
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,026
how useful he can be.

370
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Bring him along.

371
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,151
Look there!

372
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:10,693
Wild boar.

373
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:39,568
- Why do you fall over me?
- You killed it.

374
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,484
Blue arrow.

375
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,318
Blue arrow is Kumar Varma's.

376
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:46,901
Kumar Varma killed
the wild boar, bravo!

377
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,735
Again it is Kumar Varma.

378
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Wild boar.

379
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:36,610
How huge it is!

380
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,985
- Looks like a horse.
- Shut up!

381
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:06,485
Brilliant!

382
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,235
You were too good!

383
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,485
Varma's arrow is like
Lord Rama's arrow.

384
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:16,068
Long live Kumar Varma!

385
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:21,901
Long live Kumar Varma.

386
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:24,442
Long live Kumar Varma.

387
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:25,735
Amazing!

388
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:28,525
Kumar Varma's bravery
unsurpassed glory!

389
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,650
Single-handedly he killed
a sounder of boars!

390
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,650
Long live the brave Kumar Varma.

391
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,692
Long live the brave Kumar...

392
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:35,610
Stop with the flattery.

393
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,610
Yes, lord.

394
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:41,235
Devsena, we must preserve
these arrows in the royal museum.

395
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:44,401
It will motivate
the future generations.

396
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,610
I had my doubts...

397
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,525
since I set
my eyes on you your acting skill.

398
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,026
And his extra meekness.
- Me?

399
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:57,568
Doesn't look like that.

400
00:35:57,943 --> 00:35:59,183
What did you say your name was?

401
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:01,151
Shi-Shivu.

402
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:02,818
Shivu.

403
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:06,235
Held her!

404
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,849
This hand is adept at wielding
a sword in the battlefield.

405
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,818
I would know a warrior's hand.

406
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:25,150
Uncle, she is saying something.

407
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:26,775
What are you saying?

408
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,485
He is a simpleton!

409
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,151
Let me be the judge of that.

410
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,276
Bring Bahadur.

411
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,813
What is this, Your Highness?

412
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,734
A man who cannot even lift
a twig to brush his teeth...

413
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:40,067
what can he do with a huge spear?

414
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:41,193
Why are you doing this?

415
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,401
B... bull!

416
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,025
The bull is charging
Towards this coward.

417
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:52,526
My nephew will die.

418
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,442
My nephew has been killed.

419
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:08,525
What injustice meted out to a boy...

420
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,235
who has not yet seen
the flush of youth!

421
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:13,276
Is it a fracture?

422
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,025
It is over, chapter closed!

423
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,900
Who will marry him hereafter?

424
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,775
Which girl will be ready
to fall in love with him?

425
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:21,110
- Who is that big-hearted princess?
- Stop it!

426
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:22,735
Bring the chariot.

427
00:37:23,943 --> 00:37:25,734
'What will I do now?'

428
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,859
'Oh Lord! Lord! Lord Shiva!'

429
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,525
The angel who promised to help
has broken his arm.

430
00:37:32,526 --> 00:37:33,859
- Lord!
- Can you get up?

431
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,359
Imbecile! Can you not hear him?

432
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,485
Get up!

433
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,485
Adjust the pillow.

434
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,985
- Give him this brew at once.
- Sir.

435
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,086
If he sleeps well tonight,
he will be right as rain.

436
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,025
Writhing in agony like this
how can you expect him to sleep?

437
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,650
Oh Lord! Lord Shiva!

438
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,025
- Uncle...
- What? Lullaby?

439
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:09,317
You want someone
to sing you a lullaby?

440
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:12,235
Where will I find someone
to sing you a lullaby now? Who?

441
00:38:12,776 --> 00:38:15,360
Do you know how to sing a lullaby?

442
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,526
- You do not?
- No.

443
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:21,692
- What about you?
- I cannot.

444
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:22,818
Neither can you?

445
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:24,985
What do I do?

446
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
Princess!

447
00:38:28,193 --> 00:38:29,318
Do you sing?

448
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:34,942
Ever since my nephew
broke his arm...

449
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:36,192
I do not know what I am blabbering.

450
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:38,318
'Oh Lord... Lord Shiva!'

451
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:41,068
'What will I do now?
I will have to sing!'

452
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:45,359
"Where's the mother
that sings lullabies?"

453
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,025
"Where's the father
that showers love and care?"

454
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,150
"He's naïve and unaware of the world."

455
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:55,776
"Who will comfort him?"

456
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:59,317
"Lord Shiva..."

457
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:02,525
"Where's the mother
that sings lullabies?"

458
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:06,150
"Where's the father
that showers love and care?"

459
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:09,567
"He's naïve and unaware of the world."

460
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,693
"Who will comfort him?"

461
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,525
Your Highness, you are
still in your hunting attire.

462
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,735
Come, it is time for our prayer.

463
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:36,901
"Oh enchanting Lord."

464
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,901
"Nandlala Kanhaiyya."

465
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,192
"Oh enchanting Lord."

466
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,400
"Nandlala Kanhaiyya."

467
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,525
"Oh enchanting Lord."

468
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:51,859
"Nandlala Kanhaiyya."

469
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,442
"Don't tease me, oh Lord."

470
00:39:56,443 --> 00:40:01,192
"Don't try your tricks on me."

471
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:05,359
"I will go tell your mother Yashodha."

472
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,068
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

473
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:12,943
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

474
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:16,692
"Don't peek secretly..."

475
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:21,525
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

476
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:23,859
"Don't try to touch
me with your sights."

477
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:31,860
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

478
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:07,692
"When I heard the mesmerizing
tune of your flute..."

479
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:11,151
felt drawn towards you,
oh tormentor."

480
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:14,775
"Why do I sing Your song?"

481
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,692
"I'm Yours now."

482
00:41:16,693 --> 00:41:19,776
"I've fallen for you."

483
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:32,943
"Oh Lord, what has happened."

484
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,400
"How could I be so crazy..."

485
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:43,942
"to let you face a charging bull?"

486
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:48,693
"It's completely my fault."

487
00:41:56,151 --> 00:42:02,526
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

488
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:10,151
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

489
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,360
- "Kanha..."
- Oh enchanting Lord."

490
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:33,485
"Kanha...
- Nandlala Kanhaiyya."

491
00:42:34,193 --> 00:42:37,734
- "Kanha...
- Oh enchanting Lord."

492
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:41,526
- "Nandlala Kanhaiyya.
- Kanha..."

493
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,442
"Kanha..."

494
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,526
"Radha's beloved."

495
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:53,151
"Sleep, oh Lord..."

496
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:03,443
Baahubali and Kattappa are
in Kuntal kingdom now.

497
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:07,109
Staying in the palace...

498
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,567
Baahubali is pretending
to be a blockhead, my lord.

499
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:10,484
Why should he pretend?

500
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,110
That is what he is!

501
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,567
Why is he doing so?

502
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:18,442
Baahubali may be
in love with Devsena...

503
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:20,443
the princess of Kuntal kingdom.

504
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:22,776
This is her portrait, my lord.

505
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,443
He gets to sit on the throne
and marry such a beauty!

506
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,693
Devsena should belong
only to me, father.

507
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,818
How is it possible?

508
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:53,817
- If my mother gives her word?
- How can she promise you will marry...

509
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:57,693
the beauty your brother
is in love with?

510
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:02,943
She is unaware of the fact that
my brother is interested in her.

511
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,485
I intend on making the 1st move.
That's why.

512
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,235
Bhalla...?
Mother?

513
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:18,151
Neither did you come for breakfast
nor attend court like you do.

514
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:20,485
- Why, Bhalla?
- Nothing, mother.

515
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:21,669
I didn't feel like coming.

516
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:24,192
I know what is happening,
Queen Mother.

517
00:44:24,193 --> 00:44:25,275
What is the issue?

518
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:26,526
Architectural imbalance?

519
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:29,109
- Architectural imbalance?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,110
The south east corner has
become heavy suddenly.

521
00:44:31,276 --> 00:44:33,901
- Do you want to see?
- What are you saying?

522
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:36,526
Bhalla...?

523
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:39,401
I am telling you now.

524
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:40,985
Show me.

525
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,693
The most beautiful lady
who even puts beauty to shame!

526
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:01,734
- Who is she?
- Princess of Kuntal kingdom.

527
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,276
Her name is Devsena.

528
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:07,359
The moment he saw
the painting by an artist...

529
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,693
north corner
gained favor in his heart.

530
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:13,484
Are you so besotted
with this princess, Bhalla?

531
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:14,485
Yes, mother.

532
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:16,443
I want her as my wife.

533
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:18,026
What is this, Your Highness?

534
00:45:18,401 --> 00:45:21,442
You are asking
as if she is a toy.

535
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:22,443
How is it possible?

536
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:24,068
Why not?

537
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:27,526
He sacrificed the throne
of this kingdom flippantly.

538
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:30,192
So large-hearted is my son.

539
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,776
If I cannot fulfill
such a small wish of his...

540
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:34,845
how can I call myself a mother?

541
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:36,526
Bhalla...

542
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,485
Devsena will be your wife.

543
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:42,235
I give you my word.

544
00:45:48,193 --> 00:45:49,193
Prime minister.

545
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:53,525
One ornament is not worn again
for a whole year...

546
00:45:53,526 --> 00:45:56,860
send caskets with varied
jewelry as gifts to Devsena.

547
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:58,711
- As you command, Your Majesty.
- Dandnayak.

548
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:03,485
Send clothes spun in gold to the royal
family of Kuntal kingdom. As you command.

549
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:05,860
Royal sword of Bhalla.

550
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:08,735
Minister...?

551
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:11,526
Make Devsena tie
a knot to this sword...

552
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:13,401
and let the alliance be finalized.

553
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:18,400
Make arrangements for my
daughter-in-law to be welcomed...

554
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,776
with royal fanfare
amidst pomp and splendor.

555
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:36,109
'Blessings to King Jaysena
of Kuntal kingdom.'

556
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,317
'Shivgami,
Queen Mother of Mahishmati...

557
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:40,836
'...the 'Ultimate Utopia',
writes herewith:'

558
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,317
'Like Cupid in form,
like the demigods in nature...'

559
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,359
'Only the bravest of
the brave for my son...'

560
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,026
'I have chosen your sister
Devsena as his life partner.'

561
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:52,985
'Send your sister Devsena as
our daughter-in-law to our kingdom.'

562
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,109
'By the time you return...'

563
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,400
'...I will find you a princess
to narrate enchanting fairy tales!'

564
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:01,735
You have chosen the same girl
Baahubali is in love with.

565
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:06,109
'Yours truly,
Queen Mother Shivgami Devi.'

566
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,942
To seek alliance with
Mahishmati kingdom...

567
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:12,775
when so many powerful empires
are waiting in line so eagerly.

568
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:17,775
But Queen Mother's compassionate gaze
has fallen on your small territory.

569
00:47:17,776 --> 00:47:20,443
Princess is indeed fortunate.

570
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:28,110
Look at the trousseau Queen Mother
has sent to fix this alliance.

571
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:30,627
You would have never set eyes upon...

572
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,735
such wealth and
valuables in your life.

573
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:41,567
Is it just you and
your Queen Mother?

574
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:44,485
Or is everyone in
your kingdom like this?

575
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:51,192
Looking at these riches...

576
00:47:51,193 --> 00:47:53,235
you may wag
your tail like a dog.

577
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,567
This is equivalent to
dust under my feet!

578
00:47:56,568 --> 00:47:58,526
- Devsena...!
- Minister!

579
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:02,443
If your prince had even
an ounce of this arrogance...

580
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:06,443
I would have been glad
he is also a man!

581
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:09,901
Someone as brainless as him,
not just me...

582
00:48:10,568 --> 00:48:13,484
even the dogs in my kingdom
will not marry such a wimp!

583
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:15,901
- Devsena...?
- Bravo, Your Highness!

584
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,026
Your Majesty,
at least can you persuade...

585
00:48:18,235 --> 00:48:19,776
It is her decision, Prime minister.

586
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,735
You send a befitting reply, Devsena.

587
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:24,610
Write this down.

588
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,110
To Shivgami Devi, Queen Mother
of Mahishmati kingdom...

589
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:30,817
'I, princess Devsena
of Kuntal kingdom...'

590
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:32,400
'...write this with utmost humility.'

591
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:35,485
'Without appraising me of your
son's appearance and character...'

592
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:39,109
'...you send me these gifts and
expect me to think high of him.'

593
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,818
'I realize he is a spineless warrior
who hides behind a woman.'

594
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:45,596
Along with the trousseau
you have given me so graciously...

595
00:48:46,693 --> 00:48:48,735
I am sending you my sword.

596
00:48:51,235 --> 00:48:55,067
Bedeck your son with gold
and precious jewelry.

597
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,859
'Ensure he ties the knot to my sword.'

598
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,650
'Send him to Kuntal kingdom.'

599
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,484
'I will take good care of him.'

600
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:04,942
With utmost humility, Devsena.

601
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,317
- Prime minister...!
- Queen Mother...?

602
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,900
Ask our army commander to prepare
for war against Kuntal kingdom.

603
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:13,151
Shivgami...!

604
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:16,443
You don't need a divine weapon
to kill a bird.

605
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:20,860
I heard Baahubali is somewhere
around Kuntal kingdom.

606
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,442
If you send word to him, he will crush
that kingdom to pieces single-handedly.

607
00:49:25,443 --> 00:49:27,068
And bring
Devsena as his prisoner.

608
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:29,776
I stretched out my hand
seeking amity...

609
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:32,860
they seem to want enmity.

610
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:35,734
Ask Baahubali to bring Devsena
as captive to Mahishmati.

611
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:39,485
Send word to him
as Queen Mother's command.

612
00:49:39,651 --> 00:49:41,068
As you order, Queen Mother.

613
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:59,901
If she could reject such a worthy
alliance in an outburst of rage...

614
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:04,442
do you understand
how much she loves me?

615
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:08,484
But, my lord, the princess seems to be
singing love songs for that blockhead...

616
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:13,525
is what I heard from
my grapevine in the harem.

617
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,443
- That blockhead?
- Yes, my lord.

618
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:19,485
I will have him
trampled under elephants.

619
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:23,068
Baahu, a piece of good news
and an equal piece of bad news.

620
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:25,443
- Which do I tell you first?
- Tell me both.

621
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:27,610
I'll decide which is good or bad.

622
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:32,068
Queen Mother has sent word
asking Devsena to marry you.

623
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:35,901
My mother knows what I want.

624
00:50:36,526 --> 00:50:38,484
But the princess however...

625
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:42,110
has rejected the proposal angrily.

626
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,318
This is also good news.

627
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:47,943
How is it good?

628
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:49,775
Having fallen in
love with this 'me'...

629
00:50:49,776 --> 00:50:51,536
- she would have rejected that 'me'!
- Oh.

630
00:50:59,276 --> 00:51:00,568
Uncle.

631
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,818
Weapon.

632
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,651
You imbecile!

633
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:12,860
A man who scurried like a cat
is prowling like a tiger today.

634
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:15,317
- Where are you going?
- To the princess's chamber.

635
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:16,650
What audacity!

636
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:19,234
You want to meet Devsena
at this time of night?

637
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:20,193
Why?

638
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:21,901
This kingdom is in peril, Kumar Varma.

639
00:51:22,068 --> 00:51:24,360
- Listen to me.
- You dare call me by my name!

640
00:51:24,526 --> 00:51:25,943
I don't have time to explain.

641
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,151
Move aside.

642
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,693
How can you brush me aside?!

643
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:23,859
Don't stand there dazed, Kumar Varma.
They are Pindaris (Bandits).

644
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,943
Sound the alarm.

645
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:30,818
Look! Shiva.

646
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:38,692
They are attacking.

647
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:39,693
Kumar Varma.

648
00:53:40,693 --> 00:53:44,068
Time offers every spineless man an
opportunity to become a brave warrior.

649
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:46,318
This is your opportunity.

650
00:53:47,651 --> 00:53:49,275
God creates life.

651
00:53:49,276 --> 00:53:50,525
The physician saves it.

652
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:52,235
One who protects that life...

653
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,735
is a true warrior!

654
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:56,068
Princess...

655
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,110
Not 2, but 4.

656
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:00,151
Turn the wrist facing outward.

657
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:08,818
Shoot.

658
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:58,110
Wait.

659
00:56:58,276 --> 00:56:59,110
Who are you?

660
00:56:59,276 --> 00:57:01,485
This isn't the right time
for explanations, let's go.

661
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:24,359
'We are all mere cowherds, sir.'

662
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,276
'How can we fight?'

663
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:28,484
'If you fight intelligently even
a blade of grass will be an arrow!'

664
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:30,734
'Your army lacks adequate strength.'

665
00:57:30,735 --> 00:57:32,984
'Your kingdom needs
every helping hand.'

666
00:57:32,985 --> 00:57:35,901
- 'Are you ready?
- Yes, we are.'

667
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:34,526
Demonstrate your strength.
Godspeed.

668
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,860
Praise be to Goddess Bhavani.

669
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,151
Climb up.

670
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,568
Fix the hooks below.

671
01:01:18,193 --> 01:01:19,485
Sadhaka!

672
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,985
Not knowing your real identity...

673
01:02:36,026 --> 01:02:37,401
I spoke out of turn.

674
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:40,026
I kicked you on your chest.

675
01:02:40,568 --> 01:02:41,776
Only when you kicked me...

676
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,860
I realized how strong you are!

677
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:49,985
This is not blood, my friend.

678
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:51,860
It is a mark of victory.

679
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:54,026
Pronouncing you as a warrior
and not a coward.

680
01:03:02,026 --> 01:03:05,485
You saved us like God
from an unexpected peril.

681
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,026
Who are you?

682
01:03:07,693 --> 01:03:08,651
Where are you from?

683
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,372
Don't bother about who we are,
Your Majesty.

684
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:13,193
We came believing
only you can help us.

685
01:03:13,776 --> 01:03:17,151
This brave warrior
needs help from me...

686
01:03:17,526 --> 01:03:20,610
He is... in love with
a girl from your kingdom.

687
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
Is that so?

688
01:03:22,526 --> 01:03:23,775
Who is that lucky maiden?

689
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:24,860
She is...

690
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:27,276
Your... princess.

691
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,443
What more joy can one ask for?

692
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:55,651
'What is the message, brave heart?'

693
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:00,651
What is it?

694
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:06,981
Queen Mother Shivgami has ordered me
to bring you back to our land as captive.

695
01:04:14,693 --> 01:04:15,693
Treachery.

696
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:18,345
Princess,
you have misunderstood...

697
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:24,860
We hailed you as a godsend
and savior just a while ago.

698
01:04:26,485 --> 01:04:29,026
Now you want to take
me as your prisoner.

699
01:04:30,568 --> 01:04:31,651
Who are you?

700
01:04:33,276 --> 01:04:36,110
Even a sweet will taste bitter
when you are angry, Princess!

701
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:37,901
Just answer my query.

702
01:04:38,151 --> 01:04:38,901
Who are you?

703
01:04:38,902 --> 01:04:41,526
After this anger dissipates...

704
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:52,151
Crown prince of
Mahishmati kingdom.

705
01:04:56,485 --> 01:04:59,651
Queen Mother's Shivgami's beloved son.

706
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:05,609
Bravest of braves,
achieved the impossible...

707
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,985
by defeating
the invincible Kalakeyas.

708
01:05:12,026 --> 01:05:14,318
Amarendra Baahubali.

709
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:31,276
With kith and kin embraces will do,
respect is unnecessary, Your Majesty.

710
01:05:36,485 --> 01:05:39,234
Queen Mother asked for Devsena's
hand for this brave warrior?

711
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,318
Yes, Your Majesty.

712
01:05:40,485 --> 01:05:44,276
Queen Mother is unaware
Baahubali loves your sister.

713
01:05:45,193 --> 01:05:48,651
Because you rejected her son
she asked him to make you a prisoner.

714
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:53,318
My mother will never
go wrong, Devsena.

715
01:05:53,526 --> 01:05:56,485
In whatever she does, a deep
inner meaning is bound to be hidden.

716
01:05:57,526 --> 01:05:59,966
This is an error based on confusion,
not born out of contempt.

717
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,276
Come with me as my prisoner.

718
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,943
You are the brave warrior
who won over my heart.

719
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,359
If you ask me to
come as your attendant...

720
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,026
I will gladly do so
till the jaws of death.

721
01:06:16,735 --> 01:06:19,375
But disrobing me of my dignity
not even one step as your captive...

722
01:06:20,568 --> 01:06:21,568
will I accompany you.

723
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,693
From this instant...

724
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,776
till death separates us...

725
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,735
I am yours, Devsena.

726
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:39,025
'I swear based on the Dharma
my mother has instilled in me.'

727
01:06:39,026 --> 01:06:44,610
'I will not let your chastity and
respect be tarnished in any way.'

728
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:46,443
'Give me your hand.'

729
01:06:58,235 --> 01:07:01,192
We are sending our kingdom's light
with you, Your Highness.

730
01:07:01,193 --> 01:07:03,693
Don't worry,
now she's my responsibility.

731
01:07:27,235 --> 01:07:29,318
Princess, you are not hurt, I hope.

732
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:35,901
Your thoughts are flitting elsewhere.

733
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:46,110
"Oh King of Kings."

734
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:49,610
"The bravest of all."

735
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,609
"Oh King of Kings."

736
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:54,525
"The bravest of all."

737
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:57,068
"Don't ever leave my sights."

738
01:08:57,818 --> 01:08:59,442
"I am all yours."

739
01:08:59,443 --> 01:09:01,484
"So what are you waiting for?"

740
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:04,068
"Take me with you."

741
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:11,235
"Hold my hands."

742
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:14,568
"We must stride together."

743
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,485
"Devsena is all yours."

744
01:10:04,068 --> 01:10:10,817
"I want to live and
die in your arms... forever."

745
01:10:10,818 --> 01:10:17,859
"Even I cannot live... without you."

746
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:24,401
"When our hearts
united... conveys the waves."

747
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:32,026
"And I heard... the sky
sing songs of our love."

748
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:38,485
"Your love is like a dream."

749
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:45,485
"May this dream never break."

750
01:10:45,735 --> 01:10:48,901
"Devsena is your prisoner."

751
01:11:02,985 --> 01:11:05,235
"Oh King of Kings."

752
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:08,985
"The bravest of all."

753
01:11:09,943 --> 01:11:11,775
"Oh King of Kings."

754
01:11:11,776 --> 01:11:13,609
"The bravest of all."

755
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:16,485
"Don't ever leave my sights."

756
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,775
"I am all yours."

757
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:20,567
"So what are you waiting for?"

758
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:23,401
"Take me with you."

759
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:26,818
"Hold my hands."

760
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:30,318
"We must stride together."

761
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:34,110
"Devsena is all yours."

762
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,151
Do not worry about anything,
Princess.

763
01:11:59,776 --> 01:12:04,110
Our Queen Mother will take care
of you as her own daughter.

764
01:12:05,318 --> 01:12:06,526
Mahishmati.

765
01:13:27,443 --> 01:13:30,526
Royal Court, attention!

766
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,525
I ridiculed your decision
and insulted you.

767
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,860
I replied arrogantly and hurt you.

768
01:13:40,193 --> 01:13:42,776
Can you forgive my temerity,
Queen Mother?

769
01:13:43,276 --> 01:13:46,360
For this Shivgami's daughter-in-law...

770
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:48,948
a little bit of temerity
is appealing indeed.

771
01:13:53,818 --> 01:13:57,025
Come and stand next
to your future husband.

772
01:13:57,026 --> 01:13:59,235
Whether my selection is
the perfect choice or not...

773
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,485
let the people
of Mahishmati decide.

774
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:12,068
Devsena...?

775
01:14:12,943 --> 01:14:13,985
What are you doing?

776
01:14:14,693 --> 01:14:16,193
I am doing exactly as you said.

777
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,235
I chose you as bride
for my son Bhallaldev.

778
01:14:21,818 --> 01:14:23,609
What are you saying, Queen Mother?

779
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:26,193
The man I fell in love with
and you wished me to marry...

780
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,193
is Baahubali.

781
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:28,818
What is happening here?

782
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:37,817
Please forgive me, Queen Mother.

783
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:39,567
I made a huge blunder.

784
01:14:39,568 --> 01:14:42,442
The son you had referred to
in your royal message...

785
01:14:42,443 --> 01:14:44,901
I mistook it to be Baahubali.

786
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:47,567
I am responsible for all this chaos.

787
01:14:47,568 --> 01:14:49,109
Her Highness is not to blame.

788
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,151
Kattappa.

789
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:53,735
No point in dissecting the past.

790
01:14:54,193 --> 01:14:56,192
We need to focus
only on our future.

791
01:14:56,193 --> 01:14:57,193
Queen Mother...

792
01:15:03,276 --> 01:15:04,276
Baahu.

793
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,609
I have given my word to your
brother that he will marry Devsena.

794
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,526
Stop it.

795
01:15:09,527 --> 01:15:13,484
Who are you to give your word
for my marriage without my consent?

796
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:15,650
Do you not know a princess has
the right to choose her husband?

797
01:15:15,651 --> 01:15:17,192
Are you not aware of that courtesy?

798
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:18,860
What audacity to raise...

799
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:22,860
your voice in front of Shivgami?

800
01:15:23,068 --> 01:15:24,442
Dandnayak.

801
01:15:24,443 --> 01:15:27,275
Tie this boorish girl
and make her kneel.

802
01:15:27,276 --> 01:15:28,693
As you command, Queen Mother.

803
01:15:42,068 --> 01:15:45,025
A hand laid on Devsena
is equal to anyone...

804
01:15:45,026 --> 01:15:47,151
touching Baahubali's sword.

805
01:15:57,985 --> 01:15:58,985
Mother.

806
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:03,775
I have given my word to Devsena
to protect her dignity.

807
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:06,692
Your Highness, are you
confronting our Queen Mother?

808
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:10,235
You are the one who once said
even Lord Shiva can make a mistake...

809
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:12,442
but our Queen Mother's
words can never go wrong.

810
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,025
'For a word given in good faith.'

811
01:16:14,026 --> 01:16:15,525
'For upholding justice.'

812
01:16:15,526 --> 01:16:18,775
'To protect the code of Dharma
oppose whoever the offender is.'

813
01:16:18,776 --> 01:16:22,275
'Even if it is God, do not be afraid.'

814
01:16:22,276 --> 01:16:23,775
'That is the Law of Dharma.'

815
01:16:23,776 --> 01:16:25,360
'Righteousness of
the warrior clan.'

816
01:16:28,193 --> 01:16:31,651
Promising your son blindly
not knowing a woman's heart is wrong.

817
01:16:35,026 --> 01:16:36,318
What you did was wrong, mother.

818
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:48,610
What Shivgami did was wrong?

819
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:51,775
You killed your mother
when you entered this world.

820
01:16:51,776 --> 01:16:54,525
Yet she nursed you,
was that wrong?

821
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:58,817
She brought you up like her own child,
was that wrong?

822
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:01,567
What is wrong to declare
you the crown prince?

823
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:04,151
Was it wrong for her
to crown you as king?

824
01:17:05,568 --> 01:17:06,901
What is wrong?

825
01:17:08,026 --> 01:17:09,901
Did you see that, Shivgami?

826
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:12,525
Your sacrifice has been called...

827
01:17:12,526 --> 01:17:14,651
a wrong deed by him.

828
01:17:15,985 --> 01:17:18,192
You must honor your promise.

829
01:17:18,193 --> 01:17:21,692
But is it alright if
your mother breaks her promise?

830
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:25,275
So your mother's promise
has no value or respect?

831
01:17:25,276 --> 01:17:26,860
No need.

832
01:17:28,235 --> 01:17:30,610
Our pearls of wisdom
are falling into deaf ears.

833
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:33,651
I realize that now.

834
01:17:38,026 --> 01:17:39,650
Amarendra Baahubali...!

835
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:41,900
You have 2 choices
laid before you.

836
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:47,360
Do you want to rule as the king of
Mahishmati, which is a slice of paradise?

837
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:50,693
Or do you wish to marry
this manipulator Devsena?

838
01:17:51,985 --> 01:17:54,775
Aspiring for the throne
if I break my promise to her...

839
01:17:54,776 --> 01:17:56,985
it will be a disgrace
to the way you raised me.

840
01:17:58,485 --> 01:18:00,485
I cannot break my promise.

841
01:18:01,526 --> 01:18:02,900
So be it.

842
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:05,567
On the forthcoming Vijaydashmi
festival, at same auspicious hour...

843
01:18:05,568 --> 01:18:07,860
Bhallaldev will ascend
the throne of Mahishmati.

844
01:18:10,693 --> 01:18:15,192
Under the supervision
of commander Baahubali...

845
01:18:15,193 --> 01:18:17,610
the grand coronation
ceremony will be performed.

846
01:18:20,235 --> 01:18:21,984
Queen Mother, kindly reconsider.

847
01:18:21,985 --> 01:18:23,776
This is my command.

848
01:18:24,443 --> 01:18:26,401
Carte blanche.

849
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:33,401
To the east of Mahishmati
is the Udayagiri range.

850
01:18:33,985 --> 01:18:38,110
Malava islands to its west.

851
01:18:39,235 --> 01:18:43,735
Many vassal kingdoms like Kuntal
are situated in the north.

852
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:48,984
Vast extensive Katkari forest
and Kalakeya forest in the south...

853
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,818
are the boundaries of...

854
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:58,067
this glorious Mahishmati
kingdom of which Bhallaldev...

855
01:18:58,068 --> 01:19:01,151
will be the sole sovereign.

856
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,067
"May Mahishmati
always be indestructible..."

857
01:19:16,068 --> 01:19:20,568
"through passage
of time indisputable."

858
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:25,525
"May all its endeavours
be victorious..."

859
01:19:25,526 --> 01:19:30,026
"until the sun,
moon, stars shine glorious."

860
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,860
Cavalry of Mahishmati.

861
01:19:33,526 --> 01:19:35,068
Attention.

862
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:37,401
Salute the king.

863
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:46,360
"Impenetrable,
fortified in every form."

864
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:48,171
"Formidable even to enemies fearsome."

865
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,360
"May warfare tactics core
be the military forms 4."

866
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:54,776
To receive His Majesty,
the elephantry pays tribute.

867
01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:05,526
"Parade a march of victory."

868
01:20:08,026 --> 01:20:09,360
Fencers.

869
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,568
"May the battlefield
display in history."

870
01:20:19,776 --> 01:20:24,025
"Mahishmati's greatness and glory."

871
01:20:24,026 --> 01:20:28,610
"Let the flag exemplify
with this emblem sky high."

872
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:32,442
"A golden throne
flanked by horses two."

873
01:20:32,443 --> 01:20:35,818
"Imprinting the glory
of Mahishmati true."

874
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,650
Under the tutelage
of Karikal Kattappa...

875
01:20:39,651 --> 01:20:42,859
exclusive troop...

876
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,485
salute the king at his feet.

877
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,360
Pay obeisance.

878
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:31,109
I, Bhallaldev, son of
Bijjaldev and Shivgami Devi...

879
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:37,192
take the noble
responsibility of ruling...

880
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:39,567
this vast empire Mahishmati.

881
01:21:39,568 --> 01:21:42,900
I hereby promise to fend and defend
my kingdom with Lord as witness.

882
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:45,193
Emperor Bhallaldev.

883
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,443
Long live... long live!

884
01:21:47,901 --> 01:21:50,692
Emperor Bhallaldev.

885
01:21:50,693 --> 01:21:52,901
Long live!

886
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:56,525
Emperor Bhallaldev.

887
01:21:56,526 --> 01:21:58,860
Long live!

888
01:22:37,526 --> 01:22:40,110
I, Amarendra Baahubali.

889
01:22:59,068 --> 01:23:01,860
I, Amarendra Baahubali...

890
01:23:02,651 --> 01:23:04,984
will protect the
people of Mahishmati.

891
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:08,817
Their health,
wealth, mortality and dignity.

892
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:12,818
As supreme commander of
King Bhallaldev's armed forces.

893
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:16,192
I will be alert every single minute
while I discharge my duty.

894
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:19,942
I will not even hesitate
to sacrifice my life.

895
01:23:19,943 --> 01:23:24,943
I take this oath of allegiance with
Queen Mother Shivgami Devi as witness.

896
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:40,901
Baahubali, long live!

897
01:23:41,443 --> 01:23:49,443
Baahubali, long live!

898
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:11,443
Mahishmati.

899
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,359
From my earliest memories...

900
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,318
I have always longed for you.

901
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:17,984
Even in my dreams and sleep...

902
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:20,318
I placed you on my head.

903
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:23,776
After all these years.

904
01:25:24,026 --> 01:25:25,818
After all these ploys.

905
01:25:26,193 --> 01:25:29,485
Though in the palm of my hand,
I cannot clasp you!

906
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:33,525
Why are you evading me?

907
01:25:33,526 --> 01:25:34,567
When I gave you pride of place...

908
01:25:34,568 --> 01:25:36,901
why did you prefer Baahubali to me?

909
01:25:46,443 --> 01:25:47,610
Bhalla.

910
01:25:48,526 --> 01:25:50,401
Now you are the king.

911
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,068
Order Baahubali to be killed.

912
01:25:53,568 --> 01:25:55,318
No one can oppose you.

913
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:56,776
Close his chapter.

914
01:25:58,193 --> 01:25:59,984
I have the authority...

915
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:01,401
only to command.

916
01:26:02,068 --> 01:26:03,609
The power to execute...

917
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,026
is still with Queen Mother.

918
01:26:07,193 --> 01:26:08,735
I must change that.

919
01:26:09,193 --> 01:26:10,735
Change Shivgami?

920
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:16,943
The sun cannot rise
in the west, Bhalla.

921
01:26:21,526 --> 01:26:24,109
The sun will never rise in the west.

922
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:26,943
But I shall bury it in the east.

923
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,235
Shivgami, you nursed a snake
and nurtured it on your lap.

924
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:33,568
It is now baring its fangs.

925
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:37,651
In another few days
it will bite you.

926
01:26:42,026 --> 01:26:45,485
You never valued my words.

927
01:27:09,068 --> 01:27:11,818
I am the cause for your mother
and you drifting apart.

928
01:27:13,193 --> 01:27:14,651
I feel distressed by that burden.

929
01:27:15,443 --> 01:27:18,693
My mother's anger will last
only till we give her a grandson.

930
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:28,276
"In the mother's womb
rests baby Nandlala."

931
01:27:34,693 --> 01:27:35,985
Place these offerings here.

932
01:27:36,526 --> 01:27:38,318
The rest over there.

933
01:27:41,693 --> 01:27:46,151
"Offer a veil to mother Yashoda.
Come over Nand and offer her gifts."

934
01:27:47,318 --> 01:27:49,068
Worried your mother
has not come as yet?

935
01:27:49,526 --> 01:27:53,485
She will definitely attend.
I know for sure.

936
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,151
Kattappa...?

937
01:27:58,776 --> 01:27:59,900
Your Highness.

938
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:01,901
You have not brought
any gift for me?

939
01:28:03,443 --> 01:28:07,360
I am a slave who
is not even privileged...

940
01:28:07,735 --> 01:28:09,815
to wish you wholeheartedly.
What gift can I offer?

941
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,109
If I ask you for something
you can do, will you comply?

942
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:14,151
My pleasure.

943
01:28:14,318 --> 01:28:17,109
According to our custom
after birth...

944
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:19,485
the baby should be held
1st by his grandfather.

945
01:28:19,985 --> 01:28:21,692
To live a long happy life.

946
01:28:21,693 --> 01:28:24,985
My father is not alive,
neither is his father.

947
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:28,151
Will you do us the honor, Kattappa?

948
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,776
For a slave who has no right
to even stand near you...

949
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:37,693
you have elevated me
to a father's position.

950
01:28:39,776 --> 01:28:41,776
I will hold your baby
not only in my hand...

951
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,651
but carry him over my head.

952
01:28:46,276 --> 01:28:49,568
Welcome Queen Mother Shivgami Devi!

953
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:01,318
Mother...?

954
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:08,568
You are bearing the heir
of Mahishmati kingdom.

955
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:10,860
Take all precautions.

956
01:29:12,943 --> 01:29:15,860
You lost the privilege to
address her as 'mother'.

957
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:20,235
Her graceful presence here
is only as Queen Mother.

958
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:27,318
Am I late?

959
01:29:35,318 --> 01:29:37,610
For the cub born to
this tigress.

960
01:29:37,943 --> 01:29:39,276
For the little tiger.

961
01:29:40,401 --> 01:29:43,359
Kumar hunted and killed
this tiger by himself you know?

962
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,651
Really, Kumar...?

963
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:48,109
If a hand wields
Baahubali's sword...

964
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:50,609
if Baahubali's words
are deep seated in any heart...

965
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:53,943
even a new born baby
can kill a tiger!

966
01:29:59,901 --> 01:30:03,400
Welcome King Bhallaldev.

967
01:30:03,401 --> 01:30:05,026
Attention!

968
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:11,234
I will give you a special gift
which no one else can offer.

969
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:12,400
What gift is that, Your Majesty?

970
01:30:12,401 --> 01:30:15,359
A pregnant woman about to deliver
does not desire riches or possessions.

971
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,985
She wants only her husband's embrace.

972
01:30:18,485 --> 01:30:19,693
Baahu.

973
01:30:20,068 --> 01:30:24,568
In performing your official duties,
you are forgetting Devsena.

974
01:30:25,485 --> 01:30:28,525
Therefore I am relieving
you of your duty...

975
01:30:28,526 --> 01:30:31,026
and transferring it to Setupaty.

976
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,520
Your ordinance, Your Majesty.

977
01:30:37,318 --> 01:30:38,318
Baahu...?

978
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,359
When such a drama is being
enacted in front of you...

979
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,318
are you watching
like a statue, Queen Mother?

980
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:02,026
Devsena...?

981
01:31:02,193 --> 01:31:04,485
You have not understood
our customs as yet.

982
01:31:04,943 --> 01:31:07,610
The power to decide who is
conferred which designation...

983
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:10,068
lies on the king entirely.

984
01:31:11,485 --> 01:31:12,984
Lame excuses.

985
01:31:12,985 --> 01:31:14,525
Queen Mother...?

986
01:31:14,526 --> 01:31:19,484
Compared to a villain's violence a
good man's silence shatters a kingdom.

987
01:31:19,485 --> 01:31:21,276
'Are you unaware of that?'

988
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:24,817
How can this title
from a brave warrior...

989
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:27,025
be thrown to a dog?

990
01:31:27,026 --> 01:31:28,776
- How can you be quiet?
- Devsena...!

991
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:31,775
All our guests came
laden with gifts.

992
01:31:31,776 --> 01:31:34,485
You have not given me any gift.
Will you give me what I ask?

993
01:31:36,568 --> 01:31:39,693
You must occupy
Mahishmati's throne.

994
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:44,860
That is my wish.

995
01:31:45,235 --> 01:31:46,525
Not just mine.

996
01:31:46,526 --> 01:31:48,442
People of our kingdom
wish the same too.

997
01:31:48,443 --> 01:31:51,609
It's said that a Warrior's duty
is to fulfill people's wishes.

998
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:52,860
Then do so.

999
01:31:57,818 --> 01:31:58,985
Mother...?

1000
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:14,651
Salutations, Your Highness.

1001
01:32:18,068 --> 01:32:22,151
Time for the king to arrive now.
Whoever it may be...

1002
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,735
go through the next line.

1003
01:32:31,943 --> 01:32:33,359
You can enter.

1004
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,068
It is alright.

1005
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:35,318
You go ahead.

1006
01:32:38,443 --> 01:32:39,817
'Come.'

1007
01:32:39,818 --> 01:32:41,442
'Come forward'.

1008
01:32:41,443 --> 01:32:43,318
'So many are waiting behind you.'

1009
01:32:44,026 --> 01:32:45,651
'Everyone should step forward. Quick.'

1010
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,901
You will be next.

1011
01:33:06,693 --> 01:33:07,943
Arrest her.

1012
01:33:08,193 --> 01:33:09,526
Arrest her.

1013
01:33:10,693 --> 01:33:14,484
'Devsena,
wife of Baahubali is accused of...'

1014
01:33:14,485 --> 01:33:18,192
'...chopping the commander
Setupaty's fingers.'

1015
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:21,900
'With Queen Mother Shivgami
Devi's permission...'

1016
01:33:21,901 --> 01:33:29,109
'Under the jurisprudence of King Bhallaldev,
the interrogation will commence now.'

1017
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,568
Go ahead.

1018
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:35,775
Is there anything you wish
to speak, Devsena?

1019
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:39,443
Without a fair trial
you have already handcuffed me.

1020
01:33:39,651 --> 01:33:42,525
You have already charged me
guilty of the crime.

1021
01:33:42,526 --> 01:33:46,484
- Is this what you call 'justice'?
- You are guilty until proven innocent.

1022
01:33:46,485 --> 01:33:48,442
This is the law of Mahishmati.

1023
01:33:48,443 --> 01:33:52,650
Even barbarians will not
frame a law like this.

1024
01:33:52,651 --> 01:33:55,275
Throw your code of laws
into the fire.

1025
01:33:55,276 --> 01:33:57,525
Toss your covenants into the sea,
bury your treatise..

1026
01:33:57,526 --> 01:33:59,525
Deep into the ground.

1027
01:33:59,526 --> 01:34:03,443
Irony is this kingdom is named
Mahishmati, meaning 'Ultimate Utopia.'

1028
01:34:03,818 --> 01:34:05,442
Devsena...!

1029
01:34:05,443 --> 01:34:07,484
About our great, renowned kingdom...

1030
01:34:07,485 --> 01:34:09,734
if you utter another
blasphemous word...

1031
01:34:09,735 --> 01:34:12,525
Fame is never measured
by gigantic thrones...

1032
01:34:12,526 --> 01:34:14,817
and golden statues, Queen Mother.

1033
01:34:14,818 --> 01:34:16,775
Only through compassion.

1034
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:18,817
No one here has
big hearts or open minds.

1035
01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:20,109
Shameful!

1036
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:21,276
You heard her, Your Majesty?

1037
01:34:21,485 --> 01:34:24,192
If she can deride us
right in front of you...

1038
01:34:24,193 --> 01:34:27,110
in your absence imagine
how low she would have stooped.

1039
01:34:27,276 --> 01:34:28,693
Think about it, Your Highness.

1040
01:34:36,193 --> 01:34:37,400
Baahubali...!

1041
01:34:37,401 --> 01:34:38,901
Baahubali is here.

1042
01:35:10,943 --> 01:35:12,192
What happened?

1043
01:35:12,193 --> 01:35:13,068
Tell me, Setupaty.

1044
01:35:13,069 --> 01:35:15,525
The temple was
thronging with devotees.

1045
01:35:15,526 --> 01:35:17,860
Devsena also arrived.

1046
01:35:18,568 --> 01:35:19,648
You were about to arrive...

1047
01:35:20,985 --> 01:35:23,568
Since you was
about to arrive, I told her...

1048
01:35:24,735 --> 01:35:27,150
I told her to enter
through another line.

1049
01:35:27,151 --> 01:35:30,067
Baahu, what is this?

1050
01:35:30,068 --> 01:35:31,775
You are intimidating the victim.

1051
01:35:31,776 --> 01:35:34,859
The truth will not be disclosed
if asked politely, Your Majesty.

1052
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:37,192
You are crossing your limit,
Baahubali.

1053
01:35:37,193 --> 01:35:40,109
When this court chained
a woman in her final trimester...

1054
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,359
this court already
crossed its limit, mother.

1055
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,067
Be it a pregnant woman,
tottering old hag, you or me...

1056
01:35:45,068 --> 01:35:46,900
rules of interrogation
are the same.

1057
01:35:46,901 --> 01:35:48,567
Do you know what happened?

1058
01:35:48,568 --> 01:35:50,192
What happened, Devsena?

1059
01:35:50,193 --> 01:35:52,593
He asked the women to form
a separate line inside the temple.

1060
01:35:53,401 --> 01:35:56,525
Then he made a pass at them.

1061
01:35:56,526 --> 01:35:58,984
- He was about to grope me too.
- 'She is lying.'

1062
01:35:58,985 --> 01:36:02,109
- I chopped his fingers.
- You did wrong, Devsena.

1063
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:04,692
If one lays a hand on any woman,
you should not chop his fingers.

1064
01:36:04,693 --> 01:36:07,692
You should chop his head!

1065
01:36:07,693 --> 01:36:12,442
'Our Mahishmati kingdom
is indestructible."

1066
01:36:12,443 --> 01:36:17,400
"Through passage of time,
indisputable."

1067
01:36:17,401 --> 01:36:25,401
"With the sun, moon, stars glorious
aligned triumphant, always victorious."

1068
01:36:27,985 --> 01:36:29,192
Baahubali...!

1069
01:36:29,193 --> 01:36:31,192
What audacity!
How dare you insult my court?

1070
01:36:31,193 --> 01:36:33,735
Since Setupaty was guilty,
he was perturbed and panic-stricken.

1071
01:36:34,943 --> 01:36:37,943
Because Devsena spoke the truth
she stood absolutely fearless.

1072
01:36:39,735 --> 01:36:42,775
His guilt has been proved,
he was beheaded!

1073
01:36:42,776 --> 01:36:44,235
Baahubali...?

1074
01:36:45,651 --> 01:36:48,192
As you claimed
Setupaty might even be guilty.

1075
01:36:48,193 --> 01:36:52,109
Who should interrogate
and pass the verdict?

1076
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,610
You or the king?

1077
01:36:54,026 --> 01:36:55,943
Or are you thinking
you are the king?

1078
01:36:57,818 --> 01:37:02,443
During the baby shower, your wife
wanted you to be crowned king.

1079
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:07,318
Did you choose the wrong way to act
as king to make her wish come true?

1080
01:37:07,943 --> 01:37:08,776
Mother?

1081
01:37:08,777 --> 01:37:11,525
Ignoring my repeated
warnings your wife maligned...

1082
01:37:11,526 --> 01:37:13,526
Mahishmati's constitution.

1083
01:37:13,943 --> 01:37:17,026
She scorned our
governing law scriptures.

1084
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:19,817
She uttered in many a word.

1085
01:37:19,818 --> 01:37:21,525
You proved with your sword.

1086
01:37:21,526 --> 01:37:25,025
Both your deeds tantamount
to royal treachery.

1087
01:37:25,026 --> 01:37:26,359
- Prime minister.
- Queen Mother.

1088
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,235
What is the punishment
to be meted out to them?

1089
01:37:35,443 --> 01:37:38,067
If any member of the royal family
violates Mahishmati's laws...

1090
01:37:38,068 --> 01:37:42,068
they should be banished
from the palace.

1091
01:37:44,151 --> 01:37:45,735
Mete out the punishment.

1092
01:37:47,985 --> 01:37:50,110
I want both of you
this instant, right now...

1093
01:37:50,276 --> 01:37:54,568
walk out of our royal palace
with just the clothes you are wearing.

1094
01:37:55,193 --> 01:37:58,818
On one hand is the law you trust, on
the other hand is 'Dharma' you taught.

1095
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,776
Between the two
this sword you gave me...

1096
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:06,026
made me choose
the path of righteousness.

1097
01:38:07,776 --> 01:38:10,525
Even if I am banished
under reproach...

1098
01:38:10,526 --> 01:38:15,860
I will serve and sacrifice
my life for Mahishmati.

1099
01:38:16,693 --> 01:38:19,192
"Does the sun..."

1100
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,859
"ever leave the skies."

1101
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:21,900
I shall take leave, mother.

1102
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:24,317
"Does the lamp..."

1103
01:38:24,318 --> 01:38:27,150
"ever burn without the wick?"

1104
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,525
"Does the sun..."

1105
01:38:29,526 --> 01:38:32,400
"ever leave the skies."

1106
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:34,984
"Does the lamp..."

1107
01:38:34,985 --> 01:38:37,567
"ever burn without the wick?"

1108
01:38:37,568 --> 01:38:40,110
"This is unfair."

1109
01:38:40,276 --> 01:38:42,692
"Every eye is filled with tears."

1110
01:38:42,693 --> 01:38:45,400
"You left us."

1111
01:38:45,401 --> 01:38:47,650
"How can we live?"

1112
01:38:47,651 --> 01:38:48,859
"You're our benefactor."

1113
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:50,150
"You're our support."

1114
01:38:50,151 --> 01:38:51,609
"You're our entire world."

1115
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:53,900
"You are our sun..."

1116
01:38:53,901 --> 01:38:55,860
"and the stars."

1117
01:38:59,276 --> 01:39:04,359
"Glory to you... Glory to you..."

1118
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:09,525
"Lord, always help us when in need."

1119
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:10,650
"Glory to you... Glory to you..."

1120
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:12,068
Stop crying.

1121
01:39:12,818 --> 01:39:16,567
God is leaving the temple and
stepping out to live with us.

1122
01:39:16,568 --> 01:39:18,525
Let's celebrate.

1123
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:26,526
"You're that stream."
"You're that stream."

1124
01:41:22,735 --> 01:41:24,900
"Wherever you shall set foot..."

1125
01:41:24,901 --> 01:41:27,859
"turns into paradise for us."

1126
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:32,485
"No one can understand
your divine play."

1127
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:34,650
"You're the strength of the weak."

1128
01:41:34,651 --> 01:41:36,442
As long as he is alive...

1129
01:41:36,443 --> 01:41:38,859
he will always be considered as king.

1130
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:43,692
"Those under you refuge,
need not fear anyone."

1131
01:41:43,693 --> 01:41:46,901
"Every inch of our
body is filled with joy."

1132
01:41:49,193 --> 01:41:52,193
"Swaying like the branches."

1133
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,484
How are you able to sleep?

1134
01:41:57,485 --> 01:41:59,110
He is rebelling and
renouncing kingship.

1135
01:41:59,276 --> 01:42:00,942
He claims he can solve
any problem all by himself.

1136
01:42:00,943 --> 01:42:03,026
"You don't need a king he says!"

1137
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:09,068
He is conspiring something.
I am scared.

1138
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:21,317
"You're the one..."

1139
01:42:21,318 --> 01:42:22,400
"who quenches our thirst..."

1140
01:42:22,401 --> 01:42:23,775
"Like the clouds."

1141
01:42:23,776 --> 01:42:27,360
"You're that stream of nectar."

1142
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:33,900
"Glory to you... Glory to you..."

1143
01:42:33,901 --> 01:42:39,067
"Lord, always help us in need."

1144
01:42:39,068 --> 01:42:44,317
"Glory to you... Glory to you..."

1145
01:42:44,318 --> 01:42:49,485
"Lord, always help us in need."

1146
01:43:27,526 --> 01:43:30,734
Bhalla, what are you doing
at this hour of night here?

1147
01:43:30,735 --> 01:43:31,901
Why is he here?

1148
01:43:34,401 --> 01:43:37,151
Forgive us, Your Majesty.
He escaped today.

1149
01:43:38,401 --> 01:43:40,650
Tomorrow if you do not place
his head in my hand...

1150
01:43:40,651 --> 01:43:41,485
Whose head?

1151
01:43:41,486 --> 01:43:43,734
I will chop your head and
place it in your hand.

1152
01:43:43,735 --> 01:43:44,900
- Go.
- Bhalla.

1153
01:43:44,901 --> 01:43:45,568
My lord.

1154
01:43:45,569 --> 01:43:46,651
Bhalla, whose head?

1155
01:43:47,485 --> 01:43:48,526
Who else?

1156
01:43:48,985 --> 01:43:50,068
Baahubali, of course!

1157
01:43:50,568 --> 01:43:51,775
You usurped his throne,

1158
01:43:51,776 --> 01:43:55,443
exiled him stooping down
further you want to kill him.

1159
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,860
Also his wife.

1160
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:01,735
- And her unborn baby too.
- Bhalla.

1161
01:44:02,526 --> 01:44:05,526
If you oppose me, I will disregard
the fact you are my father!

1162
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:19,192
I overheard.

1163
01:44:19,193 --> 01:44:21,860
I know about my son very well.

1164
01:44:22,651 --> 01:44:24,360
If he makes up his mind...

1165
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,650
he has to achieve it.

1166
01:44:27,651 --> 01:44:30,276
- We must inform Baahubali at once.
- Will he believe us?

1167
01:44:33,485 --> 01:44:36,151
Baahubali doesn't
understand craftiness.

1168
01:44:36,526 --> 01:44:39,401
He will never believe that
his brother can stoop so low.

1169
01:44:41,193 --> 01:44:43,109
I can see only one way out now.

1170
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,110
What is that?

1171
01:44:45,401 --> 01:44:48,651
- That is also only in your hands.
- In my hands?

1172
01:44:49,943 --> 01:44:51,235
Bhallaldev...

1173
01:44:52,693 --> 01:44:54,026
needs to die!

1174
01:44:59,276 --> 01:45:01,360
Do not say 'no', Kumar Varma.

1175
01:45:02,151 --> 01:45:03,818
For Baahubali's sake.

1176
01:45:04,235 --> 01:45:05,360
For Devsena.

1177
01:45:06,485 --> 01:45:11,860
For the unborn baby in her womb.
Kill my son Bhallaldev.

1178
01:46:01,485 --> 01:46:02,693
'Kumar Varma.'

1179
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:06,818
'Time offers every spineless man an
opportunity to become a brave warrior.'

1180
01:46:07,568 --> 01:46:08,818
'This is your opportunity.'

1181
01:46:42,943 --> 01:46:46,318
Are you totally in the dark
of what is happening, Kumar Varma?

1182
01:46:46,526 --> 01:46:49,317
Sacrificial offering
is being performed!

1183
01:46:49,318 --> 01:46:52,567
To get Baahubali's death warrant signed
and sealed by Shivgami's own hands.

1184
01:46:52,568 --> 01:46:54,985
A great sacrificial offering.

1185
01:46:56,193 --> 01:46:59,235
In that ritual, you are
a small piece of wood.

1186
01:47:01,401 --> 01:47:02,692
Look, Shivgami.

1187
01:47:02,693 --> 01:47:07,775
Baahubali gave his dagger to
his trusted aide, Kumar Varma.

1188
01:47:07,776 --> 01:47:10,192
Told him about the secret passage
to the royal palace.

1189
01:47:10,193 --> 01:47:13,359
He has sent him to
kill the king at midnight.

1190
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,900
Kumar Varma and his men...

1191
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:18,068
killed all our bodyguards.

1192
01:47:18,735 --> 01:47:23,318
'They slit king Bhallaldev's face.'

1193
01:47:27,318 --> 01:47:30,650
After all this has happened
we should not wait even for a minute.

1194
01:47:30,651 --> 01:47:33,360
Baahubali needs to die.

1195
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:39,109
Why are you still
introspecting, Shivgami?

1196
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:42,067
Discharge your duty
as the Queen Mother.

1197
01:47:42,068 --> 01:47:44,193
'Do not fall prey to
your maternal sentiments.'

1198
01:47:52,776 --> 01:47:57,693
Bhallaldev is not only your son,
he is also the ruler of this kingdom.

1199
01:47:58,110 --> 01:48:00,151
Whoever tries to kill the king...

1200
01:48:01,318 --> 01:48:03,360
he has to be sentenced to death.

1201
01:48:33,068 --> 01:48:35,901
If Baahubali is sentenced to death...

1202
01:48:37,276 --> 01:48:39,318
our people will revolt.

1203
01:48:40,985 --> 01:48:43,485
Our court will split into factions.

1204
01:48:45,818 --> 01:48:51,110
Civil war is not good for the kingdom.

1205
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:55,484
If that is the case, do you intend
forgiving him even after all this treason?

1206
01:48:55,485 --> 01:48:58,151
Baahubali's death is certain.

1207
01:49:04,901 --> 01:49:07,610
But his blood stains should not
smear the hands of the king.

1208
01:49:08,401 --> 01:49:11,235
History should not defame the king
for murdering his brother.

1209
01:49:12,318 --> 01:49:13,318
Then...

1210
01:49:14,443 --> 01:49:15,443
what is your plan?

1211
01:49:21,151 --> 01:49:22,151
Kattappa.

1212
01:49:23,026 --> 01:49:27,401
Your ancestors have pledged
their allegiance Mahishmati.

1213
01:49:27,693 --> 01:49:31,401
They have promised to obey
every command by the king.

1214
01:49:32,526 --> 01:49:34,275
Do you adhere to that oath?

1215
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:35,359
No doubt indeed.

1216
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,360
Your wish is my command.

1217
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:42,193
Kill Baahubali.

1218
01:49:44,943 --> 01:49:46,526
What are you saying?

1219
01:49:46,693 --> 01:49:47,734
'Why?'

1220
01:49:47,735 --> 01:49:48,984
'Do as you are being told.'

1221
01:49:48,985 --> 01:49:50,360
Queen Mother?

1222
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:56,360
Mother...?

1223
01:49:56,901 --> 01:49:59,151
Is this happening
with your consent?

1224
01:50:00,068 --> 01:50:01,776
I beg of you.

1225
01:50:02,235 --> 01:50:04,400
Ask the king to
take back his command.

1226
01:50:04,401 --> 01:50:06,026
Even integrity can
take a backseat.

1227
01:50:06,193 --> 01:50:08,150
Baahubali has no
mean bone in his body.

1228
01:50:08,151 --> 01:50:09,734
The son you raised.

1229
01:50:09,735 --> 01:50:11,525
He grew up drinking your milk.

1230
01:50:11,526 --> 01:50:13,525
'Your teachings run in his blood,
Mother.'

1231
01:50:13,526 --> 01:50:15,401
Baahubali has to die.

1232
01:50:21,526 --> 01:50:23,150
I won't be able to do it.

1233
01:50:23,151 --> 01:50:24,860
I cannot do it.

1234
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:31,235
As punishment for my refusal...

1235
01:50:32,151 --> 01:50:34,151
please sever my head.

1236
01:50:37,318 --> 01:50:39,235
Will you kill him?

1237
01:50:39,985 --> 01:50:42,110
Or shall I finish this task?

1238
01:50:45,526 --> 01:50:47,068
No, Queen Mother.

1239
01:50:47,735 --> 01:50:49,735
Your hands should not be
stained by that sin.

1240
01:50:54,651 --> 01:50:56,401
'I will kill him.'

1241
01:50:56,651 --> 01:50:58,442
'I will kill him.'

1242
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:00,735
Can we trust this dog, Bhalla?

1243
01:51:08,318 --> 01:51:10,026
Our prince is so perturbed.

1244
01:51:10,443 --> 01:51:12,068
Everything will be fine.

1245
01:51:13,776 --> 01:51:16,776
Kattappa is being punished
for royal treason.

1246
01:51:17,151 --> 01:51:18,401
Did you see him?

1247
01:51:20,485 --> 01:51:22,276
Hey! Do you know what you are saying?

1248
01:51:24,985 --> 01:51:26,651
Devsena, uncle is in danger.

1249
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:33,485
I have to leave now.

1250
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:43,693
He has promised to hold
our baby in his hands.

1251
01:51:44,485 --> 01:51:46,165
Please escort him
back here safe and sound.

1252
01:52:20,068 --> 01:52:22,568
Baahubali! Run!

1253
01:52:48,068 --> 01:52:49,276
Who was it, uncle?

1254
01:52:50,485 --> 01:52:51,485
Baahu?

1255
01:53:09,276 --> 01:53:10,360
Baahu...

1256
01:53:23,068 --> 01:53:26,360
Massacre them.

1257
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:34,360
Baahu, leave me here.

1258
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:39,568
Pay heed to my words, Baahu.

1259
01:53:40,193 --> 01:53:44,068
Life of this slave is not
more precious than yours.

1260
01:53:45,443 --> 01:53:47,276
Leave me.
You go.

1261
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:49,860
Leave me here, Baahu

1262
01:53:54,026 --> 01:53:55,360
Listen to me.

1263
01:53:55,776 --> 01:53:57,610
Leave me here.

1264
01:53:58,735 --> 01:54:00,193
Don't risk your life...

1265
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:02,860
Try to understand.

1266
01:54:04,443 --> 01:54:06,276
Leave me here to die.

1267
01:54:09,485 --> 01:54:12,818
Even I want to abandon you, old man.

1268
01:54:19,276 --> 01:54:23,276
You have promised to hold
my baby in your hands first.

1269
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:32,360
My wife made me promise I
will bring you back safe and sound.

1270
01:54:35,693 --> 01:54:37,400
Therefore uncle...

1271
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:39,485
Keep quiet for a while...

1272
01:54:40,485 --> 01:54:43,360
and let me continue with my work.

1273
01:54:46,401 --> 01:54:50,235
'Oh God! How do I convince you?'

1274
01:54:51,026 --> 01:54:53,151
I beg of you.

1275
01:54:53,818 --> 01:54:55,651
Go away.

1276
01:54:56,068 --> 01:54:57,735
Leave me here and go away, Baahu.

1277
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,318
Are you scared for Baahubali?

1278
01:55:04,943 --> 01:55:09,818
As long as you are by my side no man
has been born as yet to kill me, uncle.

1279
01:57:28,401 --> 01:57:29,526
Uncle?

1280
01:58:24,068 --> 01:58:26,068
Uncle...

1281
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,860
Royal command.

1282
01:58:32,526 --> 01:58:36,818
King's order to kill you.

1283
01:58:39,485 --> 01:58:41,901
Baahu...
Baahu...

1284
01:58:44,568 --> 01:58:47,860
Baahu, forgive me.

1285
01:58:55,526 --> 01:58:58,568
Take care of my mother.

1286
01:59:43,776 --> 01:59:49,776
Long live Mahishmati!

1287
02:00:24,610 --> 02:00:27,775
I suspected you unnecessarily,
Kattappa.

1288
02:00:27,776 --> 02:00:29,818
You are my dog, indeed.

1289
02:00:36,235 --> 02:00:37,901
Baahubali.

1290
02:00:39,276 --> 02:00:42,401
Amarendra Baahubali.

1291
02:00:43,985 --> 02:00:48,275
'I, Amarendra Baahubali...'

1292
02:00:48,276 --> 02:00:50,317
'...will protect the
people of Mahishmati.'

1293
02:00:50,318 --> 02:00:53,526
'Their health,
wealth, mortality, dignity.'

1294
02:00:56,943 --> 02:00:59,026
'I will protect them all.'

1295
02:00:59,443 --> 02:01:03,651
'With Queen Mother
Shivgami Devi as witness.'

1296
02:01:04,776 --> 02:01:07,401
'I take this oath of allegiance.'

1297
02:01:08,193 --> 02:01:09,985
Queen Mother.

1298
02:01:10,401 --> 02:01:12,318
Foolish mother.

1299
02:01:12,568 --> 02:01:16,192
I deceived her, making her think
you planned to kill me.

1300
02:01:16,193 --> 02:01:20,360
I made her sign and seal
your death warrant.

1301
02:01:21,443 --> 02:01:24,985
'And you took your
oath swearing on her?!'

1302
02:01:45,526 --> 02:01:47,109
'Assure us our God
is safe and sound.'

1303
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:50,192
'Queen Mother.'

1304
02:01:50,193 --> 02:01:52,776
'What happened to Baahubali?'

1305
02:02:21,276 --> 02:02:23,360
Blood of Baahubali.

1306
02:02:34,943 --> 02:02:38,400
Can we wash away this sin
from our hands in this birth, mother?

1307
02:02:38,401 --> 02:02:39,276
Kattappa!

1308
02:02:39,277 --> 02:02:41,485
You were wrong, Shivgami!

1309
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:46,400
A grave mistake.

1310
02:02:46,401 --> 02:02:49,693
You lost your temper on Baahubali
rather too rashly.

1311
02:02:50,151 --> 02:02:54,026
You were blind to the injustice
of your own blood behind your back.

1312
02:02:55,693 --> 02:02:57,401
'Queen Mother.'

1313
02:02:58,026 --> 02:03:00,109
'Foolish mother.'

1314
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:03,692
'I deceived her, making her think
you planned to kill me.'

1315
02:03:03,693 --> 02:03:07,485
'I made her sign and seal
your death warrant.'

1316
02:03:13,901 --> 02:03:16,150
When he breathed his last...

1317
02:03:16,151 --> 02:03:19,651
he did not think of
his wife or unborn child.

1318
02:03:20,526 --> 02:03:22,610
Do you know the last words he uttered?

1319
02:03:26,776 --> 02:03:28,984
'Take care of my mother.'

1320
02:03:28,985 --> 02:03:33,901
"Oh, the light of my life..."

1321
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:39,860
"I am your mother."

1322
02:03:40,818 --> 02:03:45,567
"Let me hide you in my arms..."

1323
02:03:45,568 --> 02:03:50,860
"Oh Baahubali."

1324
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:59,610
"When uncle Kattappa
is your protector..."

1325
02:04:01,818 --> 02:04:09,818
"and with your brother
Bhalla on your side."

1326
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:17,650
"When you're in your mother's arms.."

1327
02:04:17,651 --> 02:04:21,943
"forget about the world..."

1328
02:04:22,526 --> 02:04:28,610
"And weave beautiful dreams."

1329
02:04:29,110 --> 02:04:35,235
"Oh Baahubali."

1330
02:04:44,485 --> 02:04:46,400
You gave me the honor
of being your father

1331
02:04:46,401 --> 02:04:48,818
and asked me to use my
hands to bless your child.

1332
02:04:50,193 --> 02:04:52,110
But with the same hands...

1333
02:04:52,485 --> 02:04:55,401
I killed your husband.

1334
02:05:06,610 --> 02:05:10,610
Strangle that tiny throat, Shivgami.

1335
02:05:11,901 --> 02:05:15,651
Or else that baby's
cry will soon rebel...

1336
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:18,067
as a voice of inquiry against you.
Cross-examine you.

1337
02:05:18,068 --> 02:05:20,234
Roar in uproar.

1338
02:05:20,235 --> 02:05:22,234
Only if we stifle the
cry of this newborn...

1339
02:05:22,235 --> 02:05:24,943
all enemies of
Mahishmati will be annihilated.

1340
02:05:25,401 --> 02:05:26,943
Crush him.

1341
02:05:48,693 --> 02:05:51,984
Realizing the virtues
of Baahubali you have risen...

1342
02:05:51,985 --> 02:05:54,568
above the infinite sky.

1343
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:58,526
Killing the son whom I nursed...

1344
02:06:00,485 --> 02:06:03,110
I have fallen
at your feet in disgrace.

1345
02:06:04,985 --> 02:06:06,609
Other than joining
him in his abode to...

1346
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:08,985
wash his feet with
my tears of remorse...

1347
02:06:10,026 --> 02:06:11,776
how else can I repent?

1348
02:06:13,318 --> 02:06:14,651
What else can I do?

1349
02:06:24,985 --> 02:06:26,151
Mother...

1350
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:29,192
If Baahubali is dead or not...

1351
02:06:29,193 --> 02:06:30,567
the people,
typical herd mentality...

1352
02:06:30,568 --> 02:06:32,328
are clamoring for
an official declaration.

1353
02:06:33,693 --> 02:06:35,443
They will believe it
only if you announce.

1354
02:06:36,193 --> 02:06:37,485
Go and announce.

1355
02:06:37,651 --> 02:06:39,360
I will handle this child.

1356
02:06:52,151 --> 02:06:55,068
Amarendra Baahubali is no more.

1357
02:06:58,901 --> 02:07:01,276
Now your new king is...

1358
02:07:05,901 --> 02:07:09,735
Mahendra Baahubali!

1359
02:07:19,985 --> 02:07:21,942
Mahendra Baahubali.

1360
02:07:21,943 --> 02:07:28,068
Long live!

1361
02:07:29,193 --> 02:07:34,193
Long live!

1362
02:07:49,193 --> 02:07:51,442
Kattappa,
call for an urgent meeting...

1363
02:07:51,443 --> 02:07:53,110
of the council of ministers.

1364
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:58,567
The guilty should be hanged
until death in public.

1365
02:07:58,568 --> 02:07:59,859
So be it, Mother.

1366
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:02,900
Believing he had sinned...

1367
02:08:02,901 --> 02:08:05,234
you executed the death...

1368
02:08:05,235 --> 02:08:07,150
of Baahubali who was your breath,
me being a two-faced-beast...

1369
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:09,109
how will I think
you will forgive me?

1370
02:08:09,110 --> 02:08:11,234
Would I not have taken
ample precautions?

1371
02:08:11,235 --> 02:08:12,401
Guards!

1372
02:08:13,818 --> 02:08:16,693
Kill Shivgami and
the baby in her hands.

1373
02:08:17,943 --> 02:08:20,193
Come with me, Queen Mother.

1374
02:08:35,901 --> 02:08:36,901
Devsena... Devsena...

1375
02:08:39,318 --> 02:08:40,026
Get up.

1376
02:08:40,026 --> 02:08:41,026
Listen to me.

1377
02:08:41,027 --> 02:08:42,360
Mother...

1378
02:08:44,151 --> 02:08:45,943
Saving my son...

1379
02:08:47,151 --> 02:08:49,943
is equal to giving
my husband back to me.

1380
02:08:51,068 --> 02:08:53,735
Mahendra, you must come back here.

1381
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,901
I will be waiting for you.

1382
02:08:56,568 --> 02:08:58,818
Mahishmati kingdom
will be waiting for you.

1383
02:08:59,568 --> 02:09:00,985
Will you come back?

1384
02:09:24,485 --> 02:09:26,151
Your Majesty, she has escaped.

1385
02:10:04,110 --> 02:10:06,567
'Gaining full authority
as sole ruler of Mahishmati...'

1386
02:10:06,568 --> 02:10:09,360
'...Bhallaldev's atrocities
knew no bounds.'

1387
02:10:09,901 --> 02:10:12,442
'Due to his murderous
rage over Devsena...'

1388
02:10:12,443 --> 02:10:15,485
'...he reduced Kuntal
kingdom to cinders.'

1389
02:10:17,693 --> 02:10:22,317
In this world for
you to love or hate...

1390
02:10:22,318 --> 02:10:24,776
only I remain, Devsena.

1391
02:10:25,276 --> 02:10:28,026
'Everyone thought you were dead.'

1392
02:10:28,193 --> 02:10:32,901
'But your grandmother sacrificed
her life to save you.'

1393
02:10:46,985 --> 02:10:48,360
Your mother...

1394
02:10:48,901 --> 02:10:50,276
Your kingdom...

1395
02:10:51,026 --> 02:10:53,026
Waited for 25 long years.

1396
02:10:53,776 --> 02:10:55,610
Only for you, Mahendra.

1397
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:25,235
Send word to our kingdom, grandfather.

1398
02:11:27,443 --> 02:11:29,275
Ask the young, grownups, old...

1399
02:11:29,276 --> 02:11:31,318
everyone to assemble before me.

1400
02:11:33,943 --> 02:11:37,067
Sword, Sabre,
stick, spear, scythe, sickle.

1401
02:11:37,068 --> 02:11:39,526
Tell them to bring
any weapon they can find.

1402
02:11:41,485 --> 02:11:44,067
Tell them, to eradicate the disease
defiling this kingdom...

1403
02:11:44,068 --> 02:11:48,109
Queen Mother Shivgami's grandson
and Amarendra Baahubali's heir...

1404
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:51,235
Mahendra Baahubali is back.

1405
02:12:12,735 --> 02:12:15,400
They have 30000 warriors,
Your Majesty.

1406
02:12:15,401 --> 02:12:17,610
We do not even have
proper weapons.

1407
02:12:18,318 --> 02:12:20,859
Our hands are our weapons.

1408
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:23,234
This life is our wild tempest.

1409
02:12:23,235 --> 02:12:26,360
Each one of us
is a powerful army.

1410
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:33,776
Praise be to Mahishmati!

1411
02:12:35,818 --> 02:12:37,317
The golden statue.

1412
02:12:37,318 --> 02:12:40,442
The throne of Mahishmati, the
crown over my head.

1413
02:12:40,443 --> 02:12:42,526
And to rule as sole sovereign.

1414
02:12:42,735 --> 02:12:46,401
All along I assumed
only this gave me happiness.

1415
02:12:47,151 --> 02:12:48,193
But I was wrong.

1416
02:12:49,235 --> 02:12:52,110
This iron chain...

1417
02:12:53,526 --> 02:12:56,901
which made
Devsena feel hell on earth...

1418
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:02,526
These shackles.

1419
02:13:04,151 --> 02:13:07,026
When I see Devsena is
not enslaved any longer...

1420
02:13:09,193 --> 02:13:12,401
the veins in my skull
are erupting to explode, father.

1421
02:13:14,485 --> 02:13:17,693
I want Devsena.

1422
02:13:23,068 --> 02:13:25,025
Your Majesty,
Kattappa has garnered support...

1423
02:13:25,026 --> 02:13:26,525
from people to revolt against us.

1424
02:13:26,526 --> 02:13:27,693
Kattappa?

1425
02:13:53,485 --> 02:13:57,610
Why should this slave dog
Kattappa revolt now?

1426
02:15:02,818 --> 02:15:05,401
Bhalla...?

1427
02:15:35,401 --> 02:15:39,235
Every single head there which
witnessed your death will roll.

1428
02:15:39,568 --> 02:15:42,025
Bhadra, I will pile...

1429
02:15:42,026 --> 02:15:44,307
all those heads and place
yours on top and cremate you.

1430
02:15:45,443 --> 02:15:48,359
With the anguished cries
of 10,000 families...

1431
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:50,900
echoing as an auspicious tune...

1432
02:15:50,901 --> 02:15:54,860
I will bid you farewell.

1433
02:15:55,485 --> 02:15:58,610
DEATH TO THE ENEMY!

1434
02:16:25,068 --> 02:16:26,651
CHARGE!

1435
02:17:10,151 --> 02:17:12,193
ATTACK!

1436
02:19:06,443 --> 02:19:07,943
Attack!

1437
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:18,692
He was in your womb
after all for 9 months only.

1438
02:19:18,693 --> 02:19:20,859
On the other hand...

1439
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:24,150
you have been with me for 25 years.

1440
02:19:24,151 --> 02:19:29,235
So why did you leave me and
go as soon as he came back, Devsena?

1441
02:20:34,401 --> 02:20:38,401
"Dharti, earth for sustenance."

1442
02:20:39,485 --> 02:20:43,485
"Janani,
divine mother of benevolence."

1443
02:20:43,985 --> 02:20:46,275
"Avani, basis of existence."

1444
02:20:46,276 --> 02:20:49,110
Lift the drawbridge.

1445
02:21:14,026 --> 02:21:16,776
Release the arrows.

1446
02:21:46,818 --> 02:21:48,025
Wait, Mahendra.

1447
02:21:48,026 --> 02:21:50,775
The very thought of my mother being
his captive makes me burn in anger.

1448
02:21:50,776 --> 02:21:52,525
I do not care if I die,
do not stop me.

1449
02:21:52,526 --> 02:21:55,610
Was your mother's penance
all these decades to see you die?

1450
02:21:56,401 --> 02:21:57,985
It was to watch him die!

1451
02:21:59,568 --> 02:22:04,943
You are Amarendra Baahubali's son
whose radiant thoughts lit the darkness.

1452
02:22:06,068 --> 02:22:08,068
Think like your father.

1453
02:22:10,901 --> 02:22:12,651
Think like Baahubali.

1454
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:33,234
'Push... help us Goddess Shakti.'

1455
02:22:33,235 --> 02:22:36,650
'Pull harder... with the grace
of our Goddess Shakti.'

1456
02:22:36,651 --> 02:22:39,609
'Push... help us Goddess Shakti.'

1457
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:42,943
'Pull harder... with the grace
of our Goddess Shakti.'

1458
02:24:46,276 --> 02:24:51,318
- Who operates the drawbridge? Find them.
- What are you doing, Kattappa?

1459
02:24:52,651 --> 02:24:58,484
Your forefathers for generations
were servile to the king.

1460
02:24:58,485 --> 02:25:01,275
They earned unbounding good will.

1461
02:25:01,276 --> 02:25:05,360
You want to tarnish
their good reputation...

1462
02:25:06,318 --> 02:25:09,610
and go back on your word?

1463
02:25:10,818 --> 02:25:13,068
Do not succumb to this, Kattappa.

1464
02:25:13,776 --> 02:25:16,485
Set right your wrong-doing.

1465
02:25:18,193 --> 02:25:21,318
In the same way
you killed Baahubali...

1466
02:25:22,443 --> 02:25:26,568
close his son's chapter too.

1467
02:25:32,193 --> 02:25:34,735
Go, Kattappa.

1468
02:25:35,318 --> 02:25:36,568
Kill him.

1469
02:25:44,818 --> 02:25:46,984
25 years ago...

1470
02:25:46,985 --> 02:25:51,026
Queen Mother proclaimed
Mahendra Baahubali as our king.

1471
02:25:51,901 --> 02:25:53,734
Assuming he was no more...

1472
02:25:53,735 --> 02:25:56,485
all these years I have served a lie
discharging my duties duly.

1473
02:25:57,985 --> 02:26:00,360
Our truth has bounced back.

1474
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:03,610
Kattappa never breaks
his promise, my lord.

1475
02:26:05,651 --> 02:26:08,692
Half the army of Bhallaldev
is inside the fort, Mahendra.

1476
02:26:08,693 --> 02:26:11,443
We must find a way
for our troops to enter.

1477
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:13,235
I want a hammer, grandfather.

1478
02:27:01,151 --> 02:27:03,276
Shiva...

1479
02:27:28,735 --> 02:27:30,901
Light the fire, Avantika.

1480
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:35,610
Hand me the staff, grandfather.

1481
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:49,901
Go ahead, mother.

1482
02:27:52,276 --> 02:27:55,942
Before you circumambulate
Lord thrice...

1483
02:27:55,943 --> 02:27:59,901
to burn him alive and reduce him to
ashes, I will make him lie on this pyre.

1484
02:28:01,151 --> 02:28:02,859
Go ahead, Devsena.

1485
02:28:02,860 --> 02:28:07,026
Before you come back here I will
place your son's head in your hands.

1486
02:31:30,485 --> 02:31:32,110
Trial by fire.

1487
02:31:33,193 --> 02:31:34,484
Whoever completes it...

1488
02:31:34,485 --> 02:31:36,734
will never face defeat, my lord.

1489
02:31:36,735 --> 02:31:38,360
Create hurdles.

1490
02:31:39,026 --> 02:31:41,443
Stop Devsena.

1491
02:31:46,526 --> 02:31:49,109
'Before she circumambulates
the temple...'

1492
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:51,401
set the bridge on fire.

1493
02:32:01,901 --> 02:32:05,651
Cover her. Protect her.

1494
02:34:05,901 --> 02:34:09,860
How dare you break my statue's head!
How dare you!

1495
02:34:43,651 --> 02:34:45,984
You came back when all along I
thought you were dead.

1496
02:34:45,985 --> 02:34:47,317
Mere words cannot express...

1497
02:34:47,318 --> 02:34:51,901
how joyous I felt.

1498
02:34:54,193 --> 02:34:59,943
My own hands did not slay him
gave me sleepless nights.

1499
02:35:00,693 --> 02:35:04,568
You are the splitting image of him!

1500
02:35:11,443 --> 02:35:13,692
You have come to grant
me my unfulfilled dream.

1501
02:35:13,693 --> 02:35:16,360
Now you have given me the chance to...

1502
02:35:18,193 --> 02:35:23,359
pluck your heart out.

1503
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:27,026
How can I express my gratitude...

1504
02:35:27,776 --> 02:35:31,860
Mahendra Baahubali.

1505
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:55,110
Hey! Kattappa...

1506
02:38:07,526 --> 02:38:09,235
Mahendra!

1507
02:38:42,485 --> 02:38:43,235
Listen...

1508
02:38:43,235 --> 02:38:44,235
Come with me.

1509
02:38:45,193 --> 02:38:46,692
We can both die together.

1510
02:38:46,693 --> 02:38:50,275
"The funeral pyre is lit..."

1511
02:38:50,276 --> 02:38:58,276
"Smoke fills the lungs. Nevertheless
there is a yearning in my heart."

1512
02:39:04,943 --> 02:39:08,484
'Bhallaldev's anguished cries
petrified of death...'

1513
02:39:08,485 --> 02:39:12,443
'...will echo around and far beyond
the walls of Mahishmati.'

1514
02:39:18,485 --> 02:39:26,485
"See who comes your way."

1515
02:39:55,860 --> 02:40:01,234
My first order with Queen Mother
Shivgami Devi as witness.

1516
02:40:01,235 --> 02:40:05,442
In our kingdom those who believe
in hard work and justice...

1517
02:40:05,443 --> 02:40:07,984
will walk
with their heads held high.

1518
02:40:07,985 --> 02:40:10,900
And if anyone thinks of
harming these good people...

1519
02:40:10,901 --> 02:40:13,860
whoever it may be, their severed
head will burn in the flames of hell.

1520
02:40:16,276 --> 02:40:17,860
This is my order.

1521
02:40:18,318 --> 02:40:20,901
This is my ordinance.

1522
02:40:44,151 --> 02:40:47,818
"River of Life..."

1523
02:41:00,485 --> 02:41:04,360
"River of Life..."

1524
02:41:24,735 --> 02:41:30,650
"When God supports
the vow taken by humans..."

1525
02:41:30,651 --> 02:41:38,067
"even the stars,
the earth and skies bow before him."

1526
02:41:38,068 --> 02:41:44,025
"When humans use
their faith as weapon..."

1527
02:41:44,026 --> 02:41:49,776
"even destiny accepts defeat."

1528
02:42:47,901 --> 02:42:48,860
But, grandfather...

1529
02:42:48,861 --> 02:42:54,526
will Mahendra Baahubali's son
be the heir to Mahishmati's throne?

1530
02:42:55,943 --> 02:42:57,525
God only knows!

1531
02:42:57,526 --> 02:43:01,068
How would I know what lies
in Lord Shiva's mind?
