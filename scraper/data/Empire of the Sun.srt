1
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,716
Jamie!

2
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,972
Jamie, off the grass!

3
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,391
Off the grass!

4
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,735
Nice plane finish!

5
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,117
-Which side will win the war?
-Ours, of course.

6
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,579
-Oh, that war.
-Well, China isn't our war.

7
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,457
We're awfully lucky.

8
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,420
-Living here, having everything.
-Naughty!

9
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,383
The harder I work, the luckier we get.

10
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,678
I only meant lucky.

11
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,141
Luckier than him.

12
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,770
We're luckier than most.
He's luckier than some.

13
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,065
Out of the way.
Chip across the water.

14
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:03,070
The Japanese will win. They've got
better planes and braver pilots.

15
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,449
I may join the Japanese Air Force.

16
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,034
For heaven's sake!

17
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:13,372
Father, look! Zero Sen!
It's my plane! Zero Sen!

18
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,733
Amah, I'll have...

19
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,651
...the butter biscuits.

20
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,821
Mrs. Graham, she...

21
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,408
...not want you eat before bed.

22
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,706
You have to do what I say.

23
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,586
--backed by
reinforcements into Malaya....

24
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:05,091
...certain to influence Japan against
further military action.

25
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,262
As Far East tensions grow,
British nationals evacuate...

26
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,765
...for Australia and India.

27
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:18,437
A steamer left Shanghai yesterday
with 450 British on board...

28
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,106
...to Hong Kong.

29
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,776
A third of occupied China's
British community...

30
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,988
...estimated at 15,000, has left
in recent weeks.

31
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,825
Little hope of progress remains...

32
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,995
...between Roosevelt
and the Japanese ambassador.

33
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,667
Singapore revealed that Japanese
forces in Indochina...

34
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:44,004
...have reached the strength of
perhaps 50,000.

35
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,932
Hello...

36
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,685
...Ace.

37
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,484
-I was dreaming about God.
-What did he say?

38
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,780
Nothing. He was playing tennis.

39
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,661
Perhaps that's where God is
all the time.

40
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,747
It's why you can't see him.

41
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,500
I don't know about God.

42
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,214
-Good night, Jamie.
-Perhaps he's our dream...

43
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,216
...and we're his.

44
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,346
Go to sleep. It's the Lockwoods,
party tomorrow.

45
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,974
Can I take my glider?

46
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,602
Dream of flying.

47
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,325
Mother...

48
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,788
...if God is above us, does it mean
up, like flying?

49
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,790
Good night.

50
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,186
-Mistress, very beautiful.
-Thank you, Amah. Off we go.

51
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,399
Behave yourself.

52
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,317
Thank you, Yang.

53
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,446
Squeeze up.

54
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:21,078
Mind the plane. Prop it against
the seat. Right, Yang.

55
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,466
Settle down, Sinbad!

56
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,397
Take the Wang Pu Road.
Let's avoid the crowds.

57
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,347
-See you back on board.
See you, Charlie.

58
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,308
Green apples! Green apples!

59
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,553
No mama. No papa.
No whiskey soda.

60
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,324
Slow down. Checkpoint coming up.

61
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,556
God rest ye merry gentlemen

62
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,017
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.

63
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,394
-Big kisses.
-There he is.

64
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,899
-Leave Shanghai while you can.
-They leave us alone.

65
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,735
Lockwood's invited a Chink.

66
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,697
Sorry, but don't mind him.

67
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,825
-English humor?
-Scottish whiskey.

68
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,577
Are our days numbered?

69
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,914
All our days are numbered.
Ours higher than yours.

70
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:56,210
You've been in Shanghai 100 years.
It's only an incident.

71
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,921
The Japanese, four years. Nothing.

72
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,467
Long enough to spoil your harvest
and steal what's left of it.

73
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,721
A million Chinese peasants are
trying to enter Shanghai.

74
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,307
The Japanese get hungry too.

75
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,436
We have the guns, the planes
and 500 million fighting back.

76
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,190
-We'll be here after every war.
-Here's to that.

77
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,442
I hope we'll be here too.

78
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,487
Always delighted to return
hospitality.

79
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:28,075
-Very good. Utterly convincing.
-Thank you.

80
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,427
Zero?

81
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,390
Nakajima. Two machine guns.

82
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,310
I rely on you for keeping up-to-date
on the war.

83
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,938
Especially military aviation.

84
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:03,151
-I hear you resigned from the Scouts.
-I'm now an atheist.

85
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,738
-Where are you going?
-To see something!

86
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,381
Oh.

87
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,800
Your boy tells me he's an atheist.

88
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,885
Always thought he was.

89
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,888
-Chow time.
-Thank you.

90
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,598
Enemy aircraft sighted!

91
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,450
He's on my tail! On my tail!

92
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,736
Jamie!

93
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,488
Jamie!

94
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,865
Stand still, John.

95
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,053
Jamie.

96
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,430
Don't run.

97
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,825
Come, you're
missing the party.

98
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,536
-I left my plane.
-Never mind.

99
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,621
-Don't look back.
-Thanks.

100
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,624
They're waiting for something
to happen.

101
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,920
-They didn't look angry.
-It's not anger. It's patience.

102
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,508
-Is it time to close ranks?
-Get Mary and the boy out.

103
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,969
Somewhere safe. Singapore?

104
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,881
We're moving into the hotel.

105
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,634
Why?
-To see how things are going.

106
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,805
I don't want you two alone
in the house.

107
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,261
Jamie?

108
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,347
I didn't mean it. It was a joke.

109
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,350
Keep away from the window.

110
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,188
Get dressed. Do what Mother
tells you. We're leaving.

111
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,692
I am dressed.

112
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,239
Am I going to school?
There's no school today.

113
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,908
We'll see if Yang can take us home.

114
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,792
Never mind the suitcase. Come on!

115
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,338
-Taxi! Over here! Taxi!
Excuse me!

116
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,471
Good heavens, this is ridiculous!

117
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:59,771
-Keep holding my hand!
Stop shoving me!

118
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,904
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-Yang!

119
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,704
Quickly!

120
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,298
Yang, get us to the waterfront.

121
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,931
Jamie, for God's sake, sit down!

122
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,609
Jamie, get out of the car. Quickly!

123
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,585
-What will we do?
-Get out.

124
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,088
Perhaps there'll be a boat.
Sorry. Max was right.

125
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,465
Don't push me!

126
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,675
Mary!

127
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,510
Hold on to him!

128
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,224
John!

129
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,602
John!

130
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,814
Hold on.
-John!

131
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:11,319
Stay together! Hang on to Jamie!

132
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,663
Jamie, don't let go!

133
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,176
My plane!

134
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,095
Jamie!

135
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:45,853
Mum?

136
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,404
Mum! Mummy!

137
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,863
Jamie!

138
00:26:56,073 --> 00:27:01,077
Mummy! Mum! No!

139
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,162
Jamie! Jamie!

140
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:08,543
Go home. I'll find you there! Go home!

141
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,462
Mummy!

142
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:29,058
Mother!

143
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,943
Mama?

144
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,198
Father!

145
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,730
Mother!

146
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,485
What do you think you're doing?

147
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,870
Where's my mother and father?

148
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,692
Come on, man!
Come on, kid!

149
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,154
Come on!

150
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,950
Wait! Wait!

151
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,829
Come on!

152
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,832
Come on, cycle harder!

153
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,335
Wait!

154
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,628
Please!

155
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,854
Excuse me, everyone.

156
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,568
I surrender.

157
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,197
"I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender."

158
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:21,882
No mama! No papa! No whiskey soda!

159
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,261
American boy?

160
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,306
-American boy?
-English.

161
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,684
English?

162
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,270
I'm waiting for my chauffeur.

163
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,272
English boy.

164
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,777
English boy, you come now.

165
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,613
Thank you.

166
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,116
You come now.

167
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,159
-You come now.
-No! No!

168
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,912
Hey!

169
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,288
English boy!

170
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,548
Hey! Hey, English boy!

171
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,475
I surrender! I surrender. Please!

172
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,271
Please, sir!

173
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,774
I surrender!

174
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,903
Excuse me, sir.
My name is James Graham. I'm British.

175
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,613
I'd like to surrender, please!

176
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,201
Please!

177
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,120
Please, I'm British.

178
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,581
I'd like to surrender.
Please, sir.

179
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,000
Please!

180
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,713
English boy!

181
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,516
I surrender!

182
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,476
Please!

183
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,867
Help me!

184
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,537
Help me! I'm British!

185
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,872
Help me!

186
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,583
-Help me!
Stop running.

187
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:28,110
Please! No! Please!

188
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,202
Help me! Help me!

189
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,809
Hello.

190
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,814
Kid. Kid, you okay?

191
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,280
Kid, you all right?

192
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,450
I think so.

193
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,286
Where do you live?

194
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,496
13 Amherst Avenue.

195
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,083
I'm waiting for my parents.
They've been delayed.

196
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:29,129
Delayed?
Some kind of crazy British kid.

197
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,049
What's your name?

198
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,011
James Graham.
I'm writing a book on contract bridge.

199
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,140
Are you with the American fleet?

200
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,186
American fleet? It looks like
you almost lost your shirt.

201
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,275
Maybe I can help you find
your parents.

202
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,945
I know just the man.

203
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,240
Do you know General Winter?

204
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,327
My father knows important people.
Do you know my father?

205
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,622
He owns a textile mill
on Szechwan Road.

206
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,834
Mr. Lockwood? He's with
the British Association.

207
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,544
Perhaps you don't know anyone.

208
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:13,840
How about Louis Charles and Michael
of the Avenue Foch gang?

209
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,635
Know about psychic bidding?
It's in my book.

210
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,096
Let's say you need three diamonds.

211
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,098
You just think three diamonds.

212
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,643
Then your partner,
when he gets four aces...

213
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,688
...he shouts and you put down the....

214
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,649
You put down your aces and then....

215
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,651
I can't remember it now.

216
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:37,155
Probably my parents are on a ship
to Hong Kong.

217
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,116
Then they'll send for me.

218
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,243
My father will give you a reward.

219
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,372
He gave a taxi driver $5
for bringing me home from Hankow.

220
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,040
Ever been to England?

221
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,668
Kid, you're starting to get
on my nerves.

222
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,649
Look what I found under my truck.
I'm sorry already.

223
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,192
Come on in, boy.

224
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,820
He's either hungry or crazy.

225
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,448
You need to lie down?

226
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,868
My father has a cotton mill at...

227
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,494
...Pootung.

228
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:30,417
-He'll be ingratiated to you.
Ingratiated is a fine word.

229
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,210
He once gave a taxi--

230
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,465
In a minute.
Your tongue's running away.

231
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,346
That's a well-kept set of teeth.

232
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,600
Someone has paid a lot of bills
for that sweet mouth.

233
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,937
Frank, you'd be surprised how
people neglect their kids' teeth.

234
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,981
Basie, I got you three.

235
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,193
I wasn't able to sell
any goddamn portholes.

236
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,403
Those Hankow merchants...

237
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,448
...they're charging $10
for a bag of rice.

238
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,369
Cathedral School too.

239
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,121
Cathedral?

240
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,958
Is he a kind of priest?

241
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,087
The Cathedral School.

242
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:19,132
It's a school for taipans.

243
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,642
You must know some
important people, son.

244
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,644
What do they call you?

245
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,688
I once met Madame Sun Yat-Sen.

246
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,691
She didn't call me anything.
I was 3.

247
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,527
Madame Sun?

248
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,028
I was presented.

249
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,158
-Presented.
-You two keep getting presented.

250
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:49,621
We'll be up to our asses in junk,
eating rats when the Japs walk in.

251
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,040
The Japs are not looking for us.

252
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,627
Nantao Creek is full of cholera.
They've got more sense.

253
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:59,172
It's a changed world.
Even if I sell this stuff...

254
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,426
...there wouldn't be enough to get
a sampan upriver.

255
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:07,514
We'd have to strip the Queen Mary!
So we don't have any rice for you.

256
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,226
Let's leave the boy alone.

257
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,857
All these new words and now this.
Fancy candy?

258
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,712
-What did you say your name was?
-Jamie.

259
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,258
I'm building a man-flying kite...

260
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,428
...and writing a book
on contract bridge.

261
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,640
Jim. A new name for a new life.

262
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:55,103
Jim's parents got
taken with the other Brits...

263
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,772
...and now Jim's looking for them.

264
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:41,399
Don't worry about Frank, he always
eats after me. Don't you, Frank?

265
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,110
I always eat after you, Basie.

266
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,113
Because I think for us both.

267
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,157
Jim, chew your food.

268
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,328
Chew every mouthful six times
to get the benefit.

269
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,682
Frank, we might do all right
in one of those camps.

270
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,520
Doesn't look like we'll
leave Shanghai soon.

271
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,322
You're a tired boy, Jim.

272
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,374
Where am I gonna sleep?

273
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,960
Shanghai Jim.

274
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:46,006
Find any gold teeth?

275
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:50,719
Buying and selling, Frank. You know.

276
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:53,763
Life.

277
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,533
Okay, sit. Sit.

278
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,544
Make a muscle.

279
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,772
Why can't he sell me?
Nobody wants you.

280
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,066
You're worth nothing.
Skin and bone.

281
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,943
Pretty soon, you'll be sick
all the time.

282
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,187
Basie....

283
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,609
First, I could show you
some rich pickings.

284
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,279
Hundreds of houses left empty.

285
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:34,864
Is that right?

286
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:39,285
I'll show you the houses
I lived in before Frank found me.

287
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,331
They were luxuriant!

288
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,084
Luxuriant?

289
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:50,463
You had good sense being born there.
It was good living.

290
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,550
There certainly was good living!

291
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,973
There was opulence!

292
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,685
Opulence.

293
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,564
All right.

294
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,234
We'll go look at these houses.

295
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,322
Let's go, Frank.

296
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,867
Opulence.

297
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:53,151
That one has whiskey, gin
and a white piano.

298
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,363
That one has whiskey, gin....

299
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,909
-Whiskey and a radiogram.
-What about the boarded one?

300
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,413
It has a mirrored dance floor,
radiogram, fountain...

301
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,250
-...and crystal chandeliers.
-Crystal chandeliers?

302
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,378
-I think they were crystal.
-You're tired.

303
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,671
What about cash?

304
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,926
What about money?
I did see money.

305
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:21,763
Piles of notes on the table.
I'm taking you there.

306
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,598
Turn right here.

307
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,548
I knew she'd come back.

308
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,635
Take it easy.

309
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,847
Mother!

310
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,994
-Damn it, they're Japs.
-I see. Back out.

311
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,830
I can't back out! There's no reverse!

312
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,707
-Just go forward.
-Come on!

313
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,511
Jesus Christ, Frank.

314
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,108
I want these back when they're done.

315
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,621
Basie....

316
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:21,132
Basie.

317
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,516
Engine number two on fire.
On fire, come in.

318
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,811
Come in, Red Dog Leader.
Red Dog Leader, come in.

319
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,065
Adjusting propeller? Red Dog Leader.

320
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:41,569
Engine two on fire.
On fire, on fire, on fire....

321
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:46,449
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen

322
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:50,828
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even

323
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,625
It's just a little fever.
Don't worry. We've all had it.

324
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,627
Do you feel better now?

325
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,523
It's perfectly all right.
I can wash it.

326
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,785
Excuse me.

327
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,621
There's been a mistake.

328
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,499
It may have been my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.

329
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:41,022
Attention, prisoners!
For camp transport, assemble outside.

330
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,276
Outside. Make one line.
Number one prisoner group to gate.

331
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:48,029
Prisoners, number one truck.

332
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,930
Have you forgotten the cutlery?

333
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,848
No, I haven't.

334
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,857
Basie.

335
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,360
Basie.

336
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,695
No.

337
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:35,159
You can't drink water from here.
People are dying of dysentery.

338
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,037
But we can drink boiled water.

339
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,581
Boiled water?

340
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,167
Many thanks, Basie.

341
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,211
You're welcome, Jim.

342
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,214
You've got nice manners.
I appreciate that.

343
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,385
Now it's chow time.
Get in line.

344
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:55,888
Keep the ball in play,
first in line.

345
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,224
I think your father would agree.

346
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,434
Actually, he would agree.

347
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,479
After the war, you two
should play tennis.

348
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:10,653
I want you to get Mrs. Partridge's
potato while you're there.

349
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,948
I think she died, Basie.

350
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:17,577
She died, but didn't hand
in her dinner pail.

351
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,539
Okay, go. Go on. Hurry.

352
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,422
And, Ace, don't forget to bow
to the sergeant.

353
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,803
We gotta get out of here.

354
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:44,020
The camps are full. It's our
bad luck to be taken here.

355
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:54,197
The Japs haven't enough camps
for us all.

356
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,876
This is disgusting. Get some water.

357
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,012
Come on, children.

358
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,516
She's with God now.

359
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,981
What are you doing, Basie?

360
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,444
Looks like your size, Jim.

361
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,198
I don't want her shoes.

362
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,076
I don't want them.

363
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,497
-I don't want them.
-Somebody will.

364
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,624
Basie, leave her!

365
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,876
Fine! I don't want her shoes!

366
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,713
Stop it. Leave her. Leave her!

367
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,882
Stop it. I don't want her shoes!

368
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,801
Pipe down.

369
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,435
It's the lorry. The lorry!

370
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,811
The lorry!

371
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,646
Come on!

372
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,190
Come on.
-No!

373
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,445
Come on! Don't you see?
This place is to see who dies!

374
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,534
Healthy ones go. Sick stay.

375
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,746
Tell him who we are, then--

376
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,791
We don't say anything.
Just look him in the eye.

377
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,471
Name?
-George Flynn.

378
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,723
Name?
Summers.

379
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:37,943
Excuse me.

380
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:42,865
-I'm a doctor. Let me through.
That's not fair!

381
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,785
I'm a British citizen!

382
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,037
You can't do this!

383
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,222
No! I'm with them!

384
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,684
-Please!
-Please!

385
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,411
Paul. Your name Paul?

386
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,624
Get your sister to smile,
I'll show you a magic trick.

387
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:38,379
Don't leave me!
Take me with you, Basie!

388
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,799
Listen!

389
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:46,887
Listen, Basie! Take me with you!
I can't stay here!

390
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,684
I'll work for you. I'll do anything!
Take me with you!

391
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,894
Basie! Basie!

392
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,374
-Soochow.
-Soochow!

393
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,545
I've been there lots of times.
Straight in that direction!

394
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,381
Head straight in that direction.

395
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:28,429
My parents were members of the country
club. Straight that way.

396
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:34,185
I've lived here my whole life!
I know my way everywhere.

397
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:35,436
I can speak--

398
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,983
Soochow!

399
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,444
Here we go!

400
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,866
Soochow!

401
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:14,850
Nice pair of golf shoes.

402
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,686
A friend left them to me.

403
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,481
You wouldn't want
a watch, would you?

404
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,275
No. Sorry.

405
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,739
Now do you know where we are?
We're here, okay?

406
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:33,410
We have to turn left here.
We have to turn left, okay?

407
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,957
You do what I say or we'll never get
to Soochow.

408
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,334
And then you'll be shot.

409
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,005
I look after him for his daddy.

410
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,301
-You're American, are you?
-Definitely.

411
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:54,098
I worked underground
for the Kuomintang.

412
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:56,809
As a conjurer?

413
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:18,998
That must be the camp.
We'll live right by the airfield.

414
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:22,668
-I don't see a camp.
Over there. See?

415
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,421
Those huts at a distance.

416
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,617
What do I do with this?

417
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,707
They want us to carry stones!

418
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,796
Please, on the truck is
a sick old man. Please....

419
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,383
On the truck, there's an old man.

420
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,845
-No, no, no.
Please!

421
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,769
Papa! Papa!

422
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,730
I'm all right.

423
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,422
-Use your wedge!
-That boy, running wild!

424
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,216
Spends most of his time
at the 19th hole.

425
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:24,970
You'll be blackballed by
the country club, Jim.

426
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,652
Hello, Jim.

427
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:52,331
That's a splendid cabbage. Thanks.

428
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,312
Now number seven for the sketch.

429
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:19,983
'tis partly my
own fault which death or absence--"

430
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,235
"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse."

431
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:11,284
That's not fair!
Give us our marbles back.

432
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:17,749
Give us our marbles back!
At least one more chance.

433
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,252
Mrs. Phillips!

434
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,379
Mrs. Gilmour!

435
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,301
Dr. Rawlins, I've got my homework.

436
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,474
Can you do this?

437
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:42,774
Now don't speed up.
Keep the rhythm.

438
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,785
She's gone, Dr. Rawlins.

439
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:19,936
She just looked at me. She looked
at me! I've done it!

440
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,481
I can bring her back to life!

441
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:26,276
Watch her eyes. I can do it again!

442
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,446
She thought she was dying in England.

443
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,199
Stop it, Jim!

444
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:42,876
You pumped some blood into her brain,
just for a moment.

445
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:54,012
Give the mosquito net to Mr. Radik.
Just give it to him.

446
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:57,808
You give the mosquito net
to whoever's dying next?

447
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:38,765
Future passive. "I shall be loved."

448
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,894
Amabor. It's like
losing the war, dying.

449
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,438
"They were being loved."

450
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:48,066
Amabantur. Can I have his shoes
when he's dead?

451
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,776
You pragmatist.

452
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:53,238
-"You will have been loved."
-Amatus eris.

453
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,073
We have to beat them.

454
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,701
-Who?
-The Japanese.

455
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,996
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.

456
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,041
-What happens when war ends?
-Do you want it to end?

457
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:08,753
If we stay in the camps,
the Japanese will look after us.

458
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:13,884
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.

459
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,136
They'll fight the Americans.

460
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,722
You admire the Japanese?
They're brave.

461
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,808
-That's important?
-If you want to win a war.

462
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,144
We don't want them to win.

463
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,105
I know.

464
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,025
Remember, we're British.

465
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:31,735
Yes.

466
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,904
I've never been there.

467
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,907
Put that down.

468
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,368
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?

469
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:45,373
Think of it as the antidote.

470
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,918
We are never sure of sorrow
Joy was never sure

471
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,837
Today will die, tomorrow
Time stoops to no man's lure

472
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,672
With love grown--

473
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:56,176
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.

474
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:00,180
-Would you look at Mr. Radik?
-Yes, of course.

475
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,558
Those from the hospital garden?

476
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,852
I have to give Basie something--

477
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,647
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.

478
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,524
Because he only drinks boiled water.

479
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:15,695
You'll wear yourself out looking
after everyone.

480
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:20,200
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?

481
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:26,081
Young Jim.

482
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:29,751
-The caterers are arriving.
-I'll be there!

483
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:32,170
Won't taste the same without you.

484
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,348
Wait for me!

485
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,872
What about mines?
-Get out.

486
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:13,378
Maybe the Japs put down mines.
-Hey, boss. Boss!

487
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:17,299
-Boss, it's the kid.
Come in.

488
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:26,141
-Would you like a Hershey bar?
-Please!

489
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,810
So would I. Have you got one?

490
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:37,944
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.

491
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,905
There isn't enough air for you
in China.

492
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:44,701
-Here are your clothes.
-Better than the Shanghai laundry.

493
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,078
-Did you get a cork?
-I got one.

494
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,621
Good boy.

495
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:53,001
-That's fine.
-I've never seen that one. What year?

496
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,212
-'45.
-'45? How'd you get that?

497
01:17:56,422 --> 01:18:01,217
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.

498
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,512
-Can you get me a sewing needle?
-I'll try.

499
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,682
-What's that?
-It's a trap.

500
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,768
Get out of here.

501
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:13,938
It's all right. You're almost one of
us. You see that Mustang?

502
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:19,027
-It's the Cadillac of the sky.
-That's right. B-29s too.

503
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,487
B-29s?

504
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,656
The Super fortress.
A hemisphere defense weapon.

505
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:24,908
Where from?

506
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:28,703
Okinawa. Philippines. Tokyo's in
bombing range now.

507
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,748
-Tokyo?
-Time to think of going home soon.

508
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,958
We'll have to leave the camp?

509
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,544
One side feeds you,
the other tries to kill you.

510
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,797
It's turned around. It's all timing.

511
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:43,635
-Tell me when it's time? Promise?
-Promise.

512
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,762
It'd be simpler to live here.

513
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,349
You've the British dorm to go to
when they're sick of you.

514
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,267
They are sick of me.

515
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:55,480
The British dorm's so lethargic.
Will you let me?

516
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:59,692
This'll be the place on Thanksgiving.
I'll have pheasant.

517
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,902
Pheasant?

518
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,946
Just made the traps.
Works like a noose.

519
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:07,283
Stick out your arm. Neat.

520
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,452
I've seen no pheasants, have you?

521
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,913
-Outside the wire.
-Which wire?

522
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,416
-Our wire.
-That cIose?

523
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:18,294
At the edge of the airfield,
across the canal.

524
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,173
An American initiative.
Whoever delivers gets the gravy.

525
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,968
How's your friend, Dr. Schweitzer?

526
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,138
I brought Amy Matthews
back to life for a minute.

527
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:33,226
That's worth a Reader's Digest.
Increase your word power.

528
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:37,689
pragmatist.
-Good word.

529
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,068
If I set the traps, could I live here?

530
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,238
-It's a consideration.
-Take me with you?

531
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:50,034
Frankly, it's a tossup now between
you and Dainty.

532
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,369
Take me!

533
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,581
Give me a good reason I should.

534
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,459
I'm your friend.

535
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:05,383
Chow truck's here.
-Mr. Maxton keeps my place.

536
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,072
They cut the bloody rations!

537
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:34,370
-Don't worry. I'll get yours.
-You're just like your father.

538
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:43,254
They cut our rations in half!

539
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:47,050
I'll get ours. You sit down.

540
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:54,557
You cut the bloody rations!
You cut them!

541
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:27,840
Mr. Maxton.

542
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:31,219
I've got yours, Mr. Maxton.

543
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,810
I've got some! I've got some!

544
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:41,020
Hello, everybody.

545
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,846
Sit there.
Eat, please.

546
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:22,103
The rations have been cut.
They're like animals.

547
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:26,357
82, 83, 84....

548
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:27,900
Sorry.

549
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,821
87 weevils today, Mr. Victor.

550
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,910
Above average, but the trend is down.

551
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:51,716
Must you, Jim?
-Sorry.

552
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:56,721
Some of us will die just before we're
saved, so use everything.

553
01:22:57,056 --> 01:23:01,017
-You'll miss this camp after the war.
-Will I?

554
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,355
I'll locate my parents when the people
in the camps come out.

555
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:10,526
-I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
-Think I'll get the reward?

556
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:15,114
-What reward?
-You told everyone.

557
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,784
I was much younger then.

558
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,287
Why'd the Japanese close the school?

559
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,832
To punish the grownups.

560
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,630
I wonder how you'll take to school
in England.

561
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,508
It might be strange.

562
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:37,470
The best teacher's
the university of life.

563
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,846
For heaven's--

564
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:44,143
Could we finish our meal? We know
your views on the university of life.

565
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:50,358
-We should eat the weevils.
-I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.

566
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:54,821
-He said we need the protein.
-Yes, he's right.

567
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,448
We should all eat the weevils.

568
01:23:58,242 --> 01:24:00,868
Do you believe in vitamins?

569
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,497
Strange child.

570
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:13,256
Perhaps it's time you moved
into the men's dormitory.

571
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,591
You're not 12 anymore.

572
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,389
The Americans are over Nantao again.

573
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,945
They're bombing the Shanghai docks!

574
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,129
Coney Island pilots.

575
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,756
-What was that?
-A 29 going down.

576
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,134
-A 200-pounder.
-That was close.

577
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:06,345
-Too close for Nagata.
-He won't like that.

578
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,112
What's happening, doctor?

579
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:27,199
Reprisals, and damned silly it is too.

580
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:34,832
-Keep the patients from the windows.
-Yes, doctor.

581
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:23,209
Hey!

582
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:27,296
Get away! This is British food!
Leave it alone!

583
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,548
It's our food. Get away!

584
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,677
Guards!

585
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:50,361
Mines. That was a mine. I told you.

586
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,948
Somebody lobbed a grenade.

587
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,805
Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine.

588
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:21,976
I bet you there are no mines.
You can walk right through.

589
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:23,310
You got a bet.

590
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,311
So far, so good.

591
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,452
He's seen something.

592
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,580
Jim's a black cat.

593
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:37,046
That's a dead boy, Basie.
I'll give you odds.

594
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:39,048
My harmonica...

595
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:43,302
...and my next meal
against your wristwatch.

596
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,389
You're on, my friend.

597
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:06,658
I double my bet.
My next two meals.

598
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:11,121
-You'll lose a lot of weight.
-What else you betting?

599
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:13,332
-My Life.
-Who's on the cover?

600
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:25,010
Two cigarettes on Jim!
Sunglasses on Nagata!

601
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,356
Keep going, sarge!

602
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:30,909
The lucky kid.
Cleaned me out.

603
01:37:09,616 --> 01:37:12,284
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Nina.

604
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:14,953
-Would you like a Hershey bar?
-Yes.

605
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:17,831
So would I, kid. You got one?

606
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:44,668
Don't let me down, kid.
You're an American now.

607
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:56,597
How you doing, Frank?

608
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:59,910
The river's east. You can go
up the bank or up the middle...

609
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:03,955
...or go north of east,
but you gotta go across canals.

610
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:06,875
Don't know if it's buildings or what.

611
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:09,086
Where'd you get a map?

612
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,216
A cork and needle?

613
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:18,136
-A compass that actually works.
-Put it down.

614
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:21,014
-Is it time?
-No, I'll tell you when.

615
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:23,850
-You won't forget?
-Fat chance.

616
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:28,438
-I almost feel human.
-Without me, you'd have no compass.

617
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:31,817
No, without you
I wouldn't have the needle.

618
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,361
The best way is across the river.

619
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,904
Nagata!

620
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:38,115
Jim, the curtain.

621
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:40,278
Jim, come here.

622
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:45,116
You're in charge of my stuff.

623
01:43:30,413 --> 01:43:33,081
You see this mosquito net?

624
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:37,335
See?

625
01:43:37,795 --> 01:43:39,629
What's it tell you?

626
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:47,971
Rawlins is on the take.

627
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:53,727
-You're so clever, Basie.
-Yeah.

628
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:57,856
Only cost me two batteries.

629
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:01,109
How are you feeling?

630
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:03,153
I've had worse.

631
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:05,822
I was beaten by a stoker once.

632
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:08,325
Were you a stoker?

633
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:12,787
Ship's steward.
Shanghai-Frisco line.

634
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,707
Why did he beat you?

635
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:24,591
Shanghai-Frisco will be
the trip now. Huh, Jim?

636
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:29,220
Basie, where do you live?

637
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:30,680
Here.

638
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:33,558
No, I mean after the war.

639
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:35,560
Somewhere else.

640
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:45,403
Until you find a place,
you could live at Amherst Avenue.

641
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:52,911
I'd like you to come
and meet my parents.

642
01:44:55,873 --> 01:44:58,291
We could fill up the pool...

643
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,920
...and we'll eat three times a day.

644
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:08,009
You're not feeling
sorry for me, are you?

645
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:12,180
-No one feels sorry for you, Basie.
-That's right.

646
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:17,185
-And you always eat first.
-You said it, kid.

647
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:21,856
I've been thinking about
going upriver.

648
01:45:22,066 --> 01:45:23,733
I know.

649
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:26,820
Listen--

650
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:31,783
The plan is,
we're going to get a sampan.

651
01:45:31,993 --> 01:45:37,163
Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.

652
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:39,833
Are they proper pirates, you mean?

653
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:44,045
Let's just call them gentlemen
of fortune, shall we?

654
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,426
Did you ever see...

655
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:54,055
-...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
-Yes. On the newsreels.

656
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,891
I saw them crash
through a burning wall.

657
01:45:57,101 --> 01:46:01,146
That's what I'm going to call
our little outfit.

658
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,231
With 250 calibers...

659
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:06,901
...we are going to be
the lords of the Yangtze.

660
01:46:07,153 --> 01:46:09,946
Actually, that may be a better name.

661
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:14,659
It's at the beginning and end of war
that we have to watch out.

662
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:18,329
In between, it's like a country club.

663
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:23,585
But you gotta know how to stay
balanced and make the right friends.

664
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:27,756
Because this war
is definitely winding down.

665
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:29,591
And after that?

666
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,760
After that...

667
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:36,347
... I retire in luxury,
start a barber college....

668
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:50,028
What are you doing here?

669
01:46:58,204 --> 01:47:01,206
I told you to look out for my stuff.

670
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:08,671
They were bigger than me.

671
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:35,573
Look who's here.
So you were under the net?

672
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:38,493
Cleaned up your room.

673
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:47,593
Stay with me, darling!

674
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:05,486
Everybody inside, quick!
Away from the buildings!

675
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:10,074
Oh, God. Please, no!

676
01:53:10,367 --> 01:53:12,326
My husband's in there!

677
01:54:13,138 --> 01:54:18,726
Go! P-51, Cadillac of the sky!

678
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:28,694
P-51, Cadillac of the sky!

679
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:37,286
Jim?

680
01:54:40,082 --> 01:54:43,084
Jim, get off the roof!

681
01:54:43,252 --> 01:54:44,877
Jim!

682
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:49,590
Horsepower!

683
01:55:04,606 --> 01:55:08,150
Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!

684
01:55:09,528 --> 01:55:12,738
P-51! Aren't they beautiful?

685
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,908
-Get down!
-I touched them!

686
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:20,663
I felt their heat! I can taste them.
Oil and cordite.

687
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:22,999
Come back to the hospital.

688
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:26,419
Remember how we helped
to build the runway?

689
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:31,632
If we'd died like the others,
our bones would be in the runway.

690
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:36,596
-In a way, it's our runway.
-No, it's their runway, Jim.

691
01:55:36,805 --> 01:55:38,598
Try not to think so much.

692
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:41,809
Try not to think so much!

693
01:55:51,445 --> 01:55:54,655
I can't remember
what my parents look like.

694
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:03,497
I used to play bridge
with my mother in her bedroom.

695
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:09,086
She used to comb her hair.
I'd watch her.

696
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:13,257
She had dark hair.

697
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:14,063
What's happening?

698
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:20,402
The guards are leaving!
They're taking us upcountry.

699
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:23,364
They're moving us to Nantao!
There's food there.

700
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:28,244
One suitcase!
We leave in one hour! One suitcase!

701
01:59:28,453 --> 01:59:29,745
One suitcase!

702
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:32,790
Our rations are at Nantao.

703
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:42,508
He's gone.

704
01:59:44,052 --> 01:59:45,636
Him and Dainty.

705
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:50,808
He's gone?

706
01:59:52,561 --> 01:59:54,144
He's escaped?

707
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:58,816
He can't have. He promised me!

708
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,116
He knew it was time.

709
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:11,912
-Where am I gonna go?
-We'll all have to leave now.

710
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:18,752
He knew it was time.

711
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:38,314
Boy.

712
02:00:41,192 --> 02:00:43,277
Difficult boy.

713
02:01:02,964 --> 02:01:04,506
Just look...

714
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,928
...later here for escort!

715
02:04:00,642 --> 02:04:04,812
Jim, where's my husband?
Where's Mr. Victor?

716
02:07:16,045 --> 02:07:18,005
We are civilians. Listen to me.

717
02:07:18,214 --> 02:07:22,509
I am a British doctor.
They are my responsibility!

718
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,233
We must have rest and food.

719
02:07:38,568 --> 02:07:41,278
We're going upcountry, Jim.

720
02:07:43,072 --> 02:07:44,823
Will there be food there?

721
02:07:46,367 --> 02:07:48,452
There's none here.

722
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:56,835
Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry.

723
02:07:57,795 --> 02:08:02,674
Mrs. Victor.

724
02:08:03,593 --> 02:08:05,385
Come on, Jim.

725
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:10,766
No.

726
02:08:10,975 --> 02:08:14,686
Don't go. It's better here.

727
02:08:19,275 --> 02:08:20,609
Jim!

728
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:22,944
You'll die here.

729
02:08:24,781 --> 02:08:26,782
Don't worry, Mr. Maxton.

730
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:37,542
Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor.

731
02:10:21,522 --> 02:10:23,773
Mrs. Victor.

732
02:10:31,115 --> 02:10:35,076
Surrender reached the
Japanese in a broadcast by Hirohito.

733
02:10:35,328 --> 02:10:39,706
He said Japan will endure the
unendurable and suffer greatly.

734
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:44,920
The war minister and others
committed suicide outside the palace.

735
02:10:45,129 --> 02:10:48,924
Japan is devastated,
destroyed in spirit...

736
02:10:49,133 --> 02:10:51,968
...as Hiroshima and Nagasaki
have been destroyed.

737
02:10:52,178 --> 02:10:54,679
More than 100,000 people
were killed...

738
02:10:54,931 --> 02:10:59,017
...in two single-bomb explosions,
which ended the Pacific War.

739
02:10:59,268 --> 02:11:02,229
The Russian declaration of war...

740
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:05,357
...has sent a million
soldiers into Manchuria.

741
02:11:05,608 --> 02:11:10,445
Tokyo was hit with a dawn-to-dusk
raid by 1500 B-29 bombers.

742
02:11:10,655 --> 02:11:14,241
But Japan's war was lost.
Her goal to create...

743
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:17,452
...a new empire incinerated
in a flash...

744
02:11:17,662 --> 02:11:19,788
...hotter than the sun.

745
02:11:20,039 --> 02:11:23,500
Everyone stands in awe of
the new super-weapon.

746
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:28,380
Only a few scientists knew the power
in splitting the uranium atom.

747
02:11:28,631 --> 02:11:31,216
It reached us in a shock wave...

748
02:11:31,425 --> 02:11:34,511
the atom bomb.

749
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:36,638
Each of the two bombs...

750
02:11:36,847 --> 02:11:40,308
...had the power of
20,000 tons of explosives.

751
02:11:40,518 --> 02:11:43,603
Nagasaki is
Japan's gateway to China...

752
02:11:43,813 --> 02:11:46,898
...just 500 miles from Shanghai.

753
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:52,404
I saw that! I saw it! I saw it!

754
02:11:54,865 --> 02:11:56,366
The white light.

755
02:11:58,119 --> 02:12:01,746
I thought it was Mrs. Victor's
soul going to heaven.

756
02:15:34,210 --> 02:15:45,845
Jim!

757
02:16:03,197 --> 02:16:05,657
Bastard!

758
02:16:20,256 --> 02:16:21,631
Jim!

759
02:16:29,265 --> 02:16:30,890
He gave me a mango.

760
02:16:31,725 --> 02:16:34,519
I'll give you
a whole fruit salad!

761
02:16:34,728 --> 02:16:38,231
There's Frigidaires
falling from the sky!

762
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:41,359
-He was my friend!
-He was a Jap!

763
02:16:41,569 --> 02:16:43,361
The war's over!

764
02:16:45,447 --> 02:16:49,284
You walked here from Nantao Stadium?

765
02:16:53,998 --> 02:16:57,834
What did you see? Rich pickings?

766
02:16:58,043 --> 02:17:00,628
Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars...

767
02:17:00,838 --> 02:17:02,839
...white pianos?

768
02:17:09,763 --> 02:17:12,056
I learned a new word today.

769
02:17:14,476 --> 02:17:16,227
Atom bomb.

770
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:21,649
It was like a white light
in the sky.

771
02:17:24,194 --> 02:17:27,238
Like God taking a photograph.

772
02:17:29,909 --> 02:17:31,492
I saw it.

773
02:17:45,007 --> 02:17:52,513
I can bring everyone back.

774
02:17:54,433 --> 02:17:55,808
Everyone.

775
02:17:58,771 --> 02:18:01,064
I can bring everyone back.

776
02:18:02,816 --> 02:18:04,150
Everyone.

777
02:18:05,778 --> 02:18:08,071
I can bring everyone back.

778
02:18:10,491 --> 02:18:11,658
Everyone.

779
02:18:15,204 --> 02:18:18,122
I can bring everyone back.

780
02:18:19,625 --> 02:18:21,125
Everyone.

781
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:26,339
I can bring everyone back.

782
02:18:28,926 --> 02:18:30,593
Everyone.

783
02:18:32,304 --> 02:18:35,014
I can bring everyone back.

784
02:18:35,516 --> 02:18:36,891
Everyone.

785
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:40,728
I can bring everyone back.

786
02:18:43,732 --> 02:18:46,359
-Everyone. Everyone.
-Jim!

787
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:52,573
-Didn't I teach you anything?
-Yes!

788
02:18:53,367 --> 02:18:54,659
Yeah.

789
02:18:55,536 --> 02:18:59,497
You taught me people will do
anything for a potato.

790
02:19:01,875 --> 02:19:03,751
Three years with him?

791
02:19:03,961 --> 02:19:07,338
Come on. I'll take you
back to your dad.

792
02:19:07,548 --> 02:19:12,135
We'll fill the pool
and eat three meals a day.

793
02:19:49,256 --> 02:19:52,008
Kid, you want a Hershey's bar?

794
02:19:52,843 --> 02:19:55,053
Yes, please, Basie.

795
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:58,301
I surrender.

796
02:22:40,344 --> 02:22:42,178
Come along. Off you go.

797
02:22:44,514 --> 02:22:47,058
Gather in, children.

798
02:23:11,375 --> 02:23:12,541
Mum?

799
02:23:29,935 --> 02:23:32,103
Ju-- Julie!

800
02:24:06,179 --> 02:24:07,638
Jamie?

801
02:24:13,228 --> 02:24:54,643
Jamie.
