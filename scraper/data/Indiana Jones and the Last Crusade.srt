bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

320
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:18,030
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:20,650
it disappeared, and was lost

323

of the First Crusade.

Three brothers, to be exact.

325

I've heard this one, as well.

326
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:31,644
Two of these brothers walked out
of the desert 150 years

327
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:33,612
after having found the Grail

328
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,582
and began the long journey
back to France,

329
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,684
but only one of them
made it.

330
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:41,221
And before dying
of extreme old age,

331
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:43,456
he supposedly imparted
his tale

332
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:46,226
to a... to a Franciscan friar,
I think.

00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:49,628
Not "supposedly,"
Dr. Jones.

334
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,863
This is the manuscript

335
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:53,900
in which the friar chronicled
the knight's story.

336
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,502
It doesn't reveal

337
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,337
the location of the Grail,
I'm afraid,

338
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:58,488
but the knight promised

339
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,657
that two markers, that had been
left behind, would.

340
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:03,593
This tablet is one
of those markers.

341
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,663
It proves
the knight's story is true.

342
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,665
But as you pointed out,
it's incomplete.

343
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,566
Now, the second marker
is entombed

344
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:12,535
with the knight's dead brother.

345
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,237
Our project leader

346
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,105
believes that tomb to be located

347
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,441
within the city
of Venice, Italy.

348
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:23,046
As you can now see,
Dr. Jones,

349
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,999
we're about
to complete a great quest

350
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:29,168
that began almost
2,000 years ago.

351
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:31,237
We're only
one step away.

352
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:33,239
That's usually
when the ground falls out

353
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,874
from underneath your feet.

354
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:37,577
You could be more right
than you know.

355
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:38,862
Yes?

356
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,130
We've hit a snag.

357
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,766
Our project leader has vanished,

358
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:45,969
along with all his research.

359
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:47,303
Uh, we received a cable

360
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:49,205
from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

361
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,140
who has no idea
of his whereabouts

362
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,541
or what's become of him.

363
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:56,179
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

364
00:21:56,247 --> 00:22:00,783
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

365
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:03,169
You've got
the wrong Jones,

366
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:04,537
Mr. Donovan.

367
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,905
<i>[chuckles]</i>

368
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,907
Why don't you try my father?

369
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,909
We already have.

370
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:12,512
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

371
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,109
MARCUS: Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

372
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,443
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

373
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,112
I've watched
the two of you grow apart.

374
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,514
I've never seen you
this concerned about him before.

375
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:33,699
Dad?

376
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:34,867
He's an academic;
a bookworm.

377
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:36,135
He's not a field man.

378
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:38,137
Dad? Dad?

379
00:22:38,205 --> 00:22:40,473
Dear God.

380
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,745
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

381
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:47,747
I don't know,

382
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:50,599
but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

383
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,418
Dad?

384
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:54,186
It's today's mail,

385
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:56,489
and it's been opened.

386
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,458
Mail.

387
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,528
That's it, Marcus.

388
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,765
Venice, Italy.

389
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,453
What is it?

390
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,957
It's Dad's Grail diary.

391
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,327
Every clue he followed.

392
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,963
Every discovery he made.

393
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,115
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

394
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,553
This is his
whole life.

395
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,821
Why would he have
sent this to me?

396
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,690
I don't know,

397
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:34,561
but someone must want it
pretty badly.

398
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,588
Do you believe, Marcus?

399
00:23:57,385 --> 00:24:01,187
Do you believe
the Grail actually exists?

400
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:03,539
The search for the Cup of Christ

401
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,642
is the search for the divine
in all of us.

402
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,361
But if you want
facts, Indy,

403
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:10,029
I've none
to give you.

404
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:11,464
At my age, I'm prepared

405
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,666
to take a few
things on faith.

406
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:21,674
Call Donovan, Marcus.

407
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:23,743
Tell him I'll take
that ticket to Venice now.

408
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,280
I'll tell him
we'll take two.

409
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:34,771
All right, tell me
what's going to happen

410
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,239
when we get to Venice.

411
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:38,107
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

412
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:40,076
Uh, Schneider? I maintain
an apartment in Venice.

413
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:41,177
It's at your disposal.

414
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,345
Oh, well,
that's good.

415
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:44,614
Thank you.

416
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:47,633
Dr. Jones... good luck.

417
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,235
Now be very careful.

418
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:51,637
Don't trust anybody.

Yes.

Uh, how will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider

429
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,304
when we see him?

430
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:43,473
I don't know.

431
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,690
Maybe he'll know us.

432
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:47,577
WOMAN:
Dr. Jones?

433
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:48,745
Yes?

434
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,013
I knew it was you.

435
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:54,283
You have your father's eyes.

436
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:59,605
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

437
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:02,858
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.

438
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,327
Marcus Brody?

439
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,162
That's right.

440
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:07,396
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

441
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,998
Oh, how do you do?

442
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,867
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

443
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:13,035
He was very close

444
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,970
to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

445
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,839
I've never seen him
so excited.

446
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,708
He was as giddy
as a schoolboy.

447
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:20,710
Who? Attila
the Professor?

448
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,211
He was never giddy,

449
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,614
even when he was
a schoolboy.

450
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:27,733
Fraulein, will
you permit me?

451
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:28,801
I usually don't.

452
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:30,203
I usually
don't, either.

453
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,403
In that case,
I permit you.

454
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:32,605
It would make
me very happy.

455
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:33,606
But I'm already sad.

456
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:35,007
By tomorrow,
it will have faded.

457
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:36,408
Tomorrow I'll
steal you another.

458
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:37,777
BRODY:
I hate to interrupt you,

459
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:39,078
but the reason
we're here...

460
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:40,579
Yes. I have something
to show you.

461
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:42,481
I left your father working
in the library.

462
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:43,816
He sent me to the map section

463
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,484
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city.

464
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:47,754
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

465
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:50,022
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

466
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,125
Roman numerals.

467
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:55,144
Here is the library.

468
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:57,380
That doesn't look much
like a library.

469
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:59,615
BRODY: Looks like a
converted church.

470
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,500
In this case,
it's the literal truth.

471
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:03,436
We are on holy ground.

472
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:04,971
These columns over here

473
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,173
were brought back
as spoils of war

474
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,743
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

475
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:12,044
Now, please excuse me.

476
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:14,747
The library's closing
in a few moments.

477
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:17,717
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

478
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:24,156
Marcus... I've seen
this window before.

479
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:25,891
Where?

480
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,294
Right here,
in Dad's diary.

481
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,236
You see?

482
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:38,838
Look, Indy.

483
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,907
The Roman numerals.

484
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:43,476
Dad was onto something here.

485
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,261
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

486
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:47,062
but we still don't know
what they mean.

487
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,298
Dad sent me this
diary for a reason.

488
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:50,466
Until we find
out why,

489
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:51,934
I suggest we keep
it to ourselves.

490
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,102
Find something?

491
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,737
Uh, yes.
Three, seven and ten.

492
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:56,639
That window seems
to be the source

493
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:57,907
of the Roman numerals.

494
00:27:57,974 --> 00:27:59,375
My God,
I must be blind.

495
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:02,311

00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:19,731
as I possibly could.

829
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,702
<i>[sighs]:
Yeah.</i>

830
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:25,686
<i>[kicking door]</i>

831
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,724
Dr. Jones.

832
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,042
BOTH:
Yes?

833
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,643
<i>[thunder rumbles]</i>

834
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:35,913
I will take the book now.

835
00:50:37,983 --> 00:50:39,483
BOTH:
What book?

836
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:41,720
You have the diary
in your pocket.

837
00:50:41,787 --> 00:50:42,921
<i>[laughing]</i>

838
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:45,389
You dolt!

839
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:47,392
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

840
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:49,427
that he would
bring my diary

841
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:51,329
all the way
back here?

842
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:53,998
You didn't, did you?

843
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:56,217
You didn't bring it,
did you?

844
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:57,218
Well, uh...

845
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:59,137
You did.

846
00:50:59,205 --> 00:51:01,422
Look, can we
discuss this later?

847
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,224
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

848
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,226
Will you
take it easy?

849
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:06,594
Take it easy?!

850
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:07,662
Why do you think
I sent it home

851
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:08,763
in the first place?

852
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:10,165
So it wouldn't fall
into their hands!

853
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:12,533
I came here
to save you!

854
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:13,534
Oh, yeah?

855
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:16,120
<i>And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?</i>

856
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:17,255
I told you...

857
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:18,623
<i>[speaking German]</i>

858
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:26,681
...don't call me Junior!

859
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:30,968
Look what you did!

860
00:51:32,905 --> 00:51:35,239
I can't believe what you did...

861
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:39,443
Elsa? Elsa?

862
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:42,313
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

863
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:43,581
Put down the gun,
or the fraulein dies.

864
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:44,449
But she's one of them.

865
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:45,950
Indy, please!

866
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:46,818
She's a Nazi.

867
00:51:46,919 --> 00:51:48,035
What?!

868
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:48,803
Trust me.

869
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,438
Indy, no!
I will kill her!

870
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:51,673
Yeah? Go ahead!

871
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,074
No! Don't shoot!

872
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:55,360
Don't worry. He won't.

873
00:51:55,428 --> 00:51:57,512
Indy, please! Do what he says!

874
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:00,048
And don't listen to her.

875
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:01,783
<i>Enough! She dies!
[screams]</i>

876
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,269
Wait! Wait...

877
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,510
I'm sorry.

878
00:52:12,578 --> 00:52:16,914
No, don't be.

879
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:32,063
But... you should have
listened to your father.

880
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:51,199
She ransacked her own room,

881
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:53,068
and I fell for it.

882
00:52:53,135 --> 00:52:56,337
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

883
00:52:56,405 --> 00:52:57,505
Hmm?

884
00:52:57,573 --> 00:53:00,425
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

885
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:03,161
She talks in her sleep.

886
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:15,356
I didn't trust her.
Why did you?

887
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:18,076
MAN: Because he didn't
take my advice.

888
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,768
Donovan.

889
00:53:26,835 --> 00:53:28,135
Didn't I warn you

890
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:30,772
not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

891
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:32,640
HENRY:
I misjudged you, Walter.

892
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:36,177
I knew you would sell your
mother for an Etruscan vase,

893
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,246
but I didn't know
you would sell

894
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:40,081
your country
and your soul

895
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:42,233
to the slime
of humanity.

896
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,587
Dr. Schneider...

897
00:53:45,654 --> 00:53:47,889
there are pages
torn out of this.

898
00:53:56,248 --> 00:53:59,200
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

899
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:01,803
precise directions
from the unknown city

900
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,538
to the secret Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

901
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:05,873
So it did.

902
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:08,042
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

903
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,677
We must have
these pages back.

904
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,145
You're wasting
your breath.

905
00:54:11,213 --> 00:54:12,413
He won't tell us,

906
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,782
and he doesn't have to.

907
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:18,786
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

908
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:20,922
He's given them
to Marcus Brody.

909
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:22,256
HENRY:
Marcus?

910
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,341
You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you?

911
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:25,944
He's not up
to the challenge.

912
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:27,978
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

913
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:29,280
We'll find him.

914
00:54:29,348 --> 00:54:30,515
The hell you will.

915
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:32,283
He's got a two-day
head start on you,

916
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:33,851
which is more
than he needs.

917
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:36,053
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

918
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:37,555
from here to the Sudan.

919
00:54:37,623 --> 00:54:40,291
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

920
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,859
He'll blend in, disappear.

921
00:54:41,926 --> 00:54:43,494
You'll never see him again.

922
00:54:43,562 --> 00:54:47,531
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

923
00:54:48,517 --> 00:54:49,717
Does anyone here speak English?

924
00:54:49,785 --> 00:54:50,852
Or even ancient Greek?

925
00:54:50,919 --> 00:54:52,353
Uh, water?
No, thank you, sir.

926
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,855
No. Fish make love in it.

927
00:54:53,922 --> 00:54:54,905
Goodness me.

928
00:54:54,973 --> 00:54:55,906
Thank you so much.

929
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:56,974
No, I don't like that.

930
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:58,109
No, I really don't want...

931
00:54:58,176 --> 00:54:59,777
No, no, thank you very much.

932
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:02,780
No, thank you, madam.
I'm a vegetarian.

933
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:05,883
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

934
00:55:05,951 --> 00:55:07,117
Mr. Brody!

935
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:08,719
Oh, Sallah.
What a relief.

936
00:55:08,787 --> 00:55:10,955
Marcus Brody, sir.

937
00:55:11,022 --> 00:55:11,989
But where is Indy?

938
00:55:12,057 --> 00:55:13,023
Oh, he's in Austria.

939
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:14,258
A slight detour.

940
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:15,442
You are on your own?

941
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,644
Yes, but don't panic.

942
00:55:16,712 --> 00:55:18,412
Everything's under control.

943
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,431
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

944
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:21,432
Oh, yes,
of course.

945
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,616
But where
are we going?

946
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:24,001
Oh, this map will show you.

947
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:25,803
It was drawn by, uh...

948
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,838
Mr. Brody.

949
00:55:27,906 --> 00:55:30,107
Welcome to Iskenderun.

950
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:31,959
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

951
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:33,360
has sent a car for you.

952
00:55:33,428 --> 00:55:35,546
Oh, well...
your servant, sir.

953
00:55:35,614 --> 00:55:37,114
And I am his.

954
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:39,233
Follow me, please.

955
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:41,119
My reputation precedes me.

956
00:55:41,186 --> 00:55:42,987
There is no museum
in Iskenderun.

957
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:44,505
Papers, please.

958
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,540
Papers?

959
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,641
Of course.

960
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:47,775
Run.

961
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:48,776
Yes.

962
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,278
Papers. Got it here.

963
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,979
Just finished
reading it myself.

964
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:53,013
Run.

965
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:54,081
Yes.

966
00:55:54,149 --> 00:55:55,750
<i>Egyptian Mail,
morning edition.</i>

967
00:55:55,817 --> 00:55:56,784
Run.

968
00:55:56,852 --> 00:55:57,985
Did you say, uh...

969
00:55:58,053 --> 00:55:58,786
Run!

970
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:00,804
<i>[clamoring]</i>

971
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:15,803

00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,738

Intolerable.

976
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,693
Dr. Schneider.
Message from Berlin.

977
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:40,327
You must return immediately.

978
00:56:40,395 --> 00:56:42,463
A rally at the Institute
of Aryan Culture.

979
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:43,531
So?

980
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:44,866
Your presence
on the platform

981
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,268
is requested
at the highest level.

982
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:48,970
Thank you,
Herr Oberst.

983
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,538
I will meet you
at Iskenderun.

984
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:51,605
Take this diary

985
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,807
to the Reichmuseum
in Berlin.

986
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,175
It will show them
our progress,

987
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:55,176
ahead of schedule.

988
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:56,477
Without the map,

989
00:56:56,545 --> 00:56:57,845
I'm afraid it's no
better than a souvenir.

990
00:56:57,913 --> 00:56:59,080
Let me kill them now.

991
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:00,281
No.

992
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:02,449
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

993
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:03,718
