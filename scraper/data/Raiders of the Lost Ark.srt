00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:10,772
But the people
I brought are important,

170
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,773
and they're waiting.

171
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:12,774
What people?

172
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:14,710
Army Intelligence.

173
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,278
They knew you were coming
before I did.

174
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,613
Seem to know everything.

175
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,681
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

176
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,218
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

177
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:24,019
What am I, in trouble?

178
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:25,921
MUSGROVE:
Yes, Dr. Jones,

179
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,489
we've heard a great deal
about you.

180
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,757
Have you?

181
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:30,759
MUSGROVE:
Uh, professor of archaeology,

182
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,294
expert on the occult,

183
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,496
and, uh,
how does one say it?

184
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:37,266
Obtainer
of rare antiquities.

185
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,267
That's one way of saying it.

186
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,268
Why don't you sit down?

187
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:40,269
You'll be more comfortable.

188
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,303
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

189
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:44,673
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

190
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,109
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

191
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,844
at the University of Chicago.

192
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:50,879
Yes, I did.

193
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,815
You have no idea of his
present whereabouts?

194
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:56,919
Uh... well, just rumors,
really.

195
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,653
Somewhere in Asia,
I think.

196
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,388
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

197
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,024
We were friends, but, uh...

198
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,993
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

199
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,661
MUSGROVE:
Mmm.

200
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:09,231
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

201
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,334
that this is all strictly
confidential, eh?

202
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,469
I understand.

203
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,538
<i>Uh...
[clears throat]</i>

204
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,175
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

205
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:22,010
intercepted a...
a German communiqué

206
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,380
that was sent from
Cairo to Berlin.

207
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,065
Now, to Cairo...
See, over the last two years,

208
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,900
the Nazis have had teams
of archaeologists

209
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,135
running around the world

210
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:33,305
looking for all kinds
of religious artifacts.

211
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:34,706
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

212
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:35,707
He's crazy.

213
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,842
He's obsessed with the occult.

214
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,778
And, right now, apparently,

215
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,180
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig

216
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,682
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

217
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,683
Now, we've got some

218
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,217
information here,

219
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:48,587
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

220
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:52,608
"Tanis development
proceeding.

221
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:56,962
<i>[mouthing] "Acquire headpiece,
Staff of Ra.</i>

222
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,265
Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

223
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,517
The Nazis
have discovered Tanis.

224
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:05,854
MUSGROVE: Just what does that
mean to you, uh, Tanis?

225
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:06,989
Well, it--

226
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,357
The city of Tanis
is one of the possible

227
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:09,691
resting places
of the Lost Ark.

228
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,410
The Lost Ark?

229
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:12,527
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

230
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:13,695
The chest the Hebrews used

231
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:15,231
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

232
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:16,665
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

233
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,133
<i>You talking about
the Ten Commandments?</i>

234
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,735
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

235
00:17:19,802 --> 00:17:21,136
The original stone tablets

236
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,772
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

237
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,608
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

238
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:28,760
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

239
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:29,745
Well, I...

240
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:30,812
INDIANA:
Oh, look.

241
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,481
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

242
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,715
and put them in the Ark.

243
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,217
When they settled
in Canaan,

244
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:36,618
they put the Ark
in a place called

245
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:37,652
the Temple of Solomon.

246
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:38,687
In Jerusalem.

247
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,388
Where it stayed
for many years.

248
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,791
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

249
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:43,792
Where?

250
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,761
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

251
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,696
However,
an Egyptian pharaoh...

252
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,098
Shishak.
Yes.

253
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,633
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

254
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:54,669
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

255
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,671
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

256
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,440
called the Well of Souls.

257
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,674
Secret chamber?

258
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,343
BRODY:
However, about a year

259
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:04,079
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

260
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,082
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

261
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,185
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

262
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,854
Wiped clean by
the wrath of God.

263
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,224
Uh-huh.

264
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,427
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

265
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:20,062
Now you seem to know, uh,

266
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:21,263
all about this Tanis, then.

267
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,014
No, no, not really.

268
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,684
Ravenwood is the real expert.

269
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,218
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

270
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,788
Collected some of its relics.

271
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,557
It was his obsession, really.

272
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,259
But he never found the city.

273
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,612
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

274
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,547
An American being mentioned
so prominently

275
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:41,633
in a secret
Nazi cable.

276
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,667
Oh, rubbish.

277
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,235
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

278
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:45,988
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

279
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,173
Well, obviously, the Nazis
are looking

280
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,408
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

281
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:51,860
and they think
Abner's got it.

282
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:55,564
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

283
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:56,832
Well, the staff
is just a stick--

284
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:58,133
I don't know,
about this big,

285
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,835
nobody really knows
for sure how high--

286
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,871
and it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

287
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:05,807
with an elaborate
headpiece...

288
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,760
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

289
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,662
And what you did was

290
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,982
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis--

291
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,683
a map room
with a miniature

292
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,385
of the city
all laid out on the floor--

293
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:18,453
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

294
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,256
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

295
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:24,193
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

296
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,163
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

297
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:31,116
Where the Ark of the
Covenant was kept, right?

298
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:32,651
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

299
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:35,788
What does this Ark
look like?

300
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,355
Uh...

301
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,158
There's a picture of it
right here.

302
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,564
That's it.

303
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:53,722
EATON:
Good God.

304
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,957
Yes, that's just what
the Hebrews thought.

305
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,459
Uh...

306
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,778
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

307
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,014
INDIANA:
Lightning...

308
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,882
fire...

309
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,051
power of God
or something.

310
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,987
MUSGROVE: I'm beginning
to understand

311
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:10,255
Hitler's interest
in this.

312
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,957
BRODY:
Oh, yes.

313
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,926
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

314
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:17,495
and laying waste
to entire regions.

315
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,666
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

316
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:22,935
is invincible.

317
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,191
You did it, didn't you?

318
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,759
They want you
to go for it.

319
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,262
Oh, Marcus!

320
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:53,031
They want you to get ahold of 
the Ark before the Nazis do

321
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,300
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

322
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:56,535
And the museum?

323
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:57,869
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

324
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:59,337
Oh, yes.

325
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,375
Oh...

326
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,943
The Ark of
the Covenant.

327
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:08,713
Nothing else has come close.

328
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,182
That thing represents
