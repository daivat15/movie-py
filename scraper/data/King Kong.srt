1
00:00:55,113 --> 00:01:00,284
- OK Boan, how much you got here?
- About 1,800.

2
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:03,455
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.

3
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:09,878
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

4
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,966
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.

5
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:20,265
On Huangatan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

6
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:24,519
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

7
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:47,918
How are you this evening?

8
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,924
All right.

9
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:10,024
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

10
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:13,903
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

11
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:18,533
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

12
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:21,828
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.

13
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,332
You'll be sorry.

14
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,296
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

15
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:35,551
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!

16
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,550
Let it go.

17
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:24,563
- Roy.
- Fred.

18
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:30,651
Well, here's to the big one.

19
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:51,381
MAIN TITLE

20
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,770
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>

21
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:06,608
<i>Mayday.</i>

22
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:25,835
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

23
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:32,051
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

24
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:51,822
<i>- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.</i>

25
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,243
<i>- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.</i>

26
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,955
Let me know if you get anything.

27
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:09,841
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather."

28
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:18,475
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

29
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:23,313
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.

30
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:31,947
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

31
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:35,659
I sold this one to the board.

32
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:41,291
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

33
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:58,809
Men.
Carnahan.

34
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:09,071
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

35
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,371
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

36
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,460
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

37
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,588
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.

38
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,135
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

39
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:38,685
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

40
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,606
This was taken in 1943.

41
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,944
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

42
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:54,201
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

43
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,704
Let's look at another picture.

44
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,959
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

45
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,422
Same area, same fog bank.

46
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:14,514
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

47
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:20,185
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

48
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:24,524
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

49
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:29,320
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

50
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:35,828
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

51
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:40,291
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

52
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,127
OK, fellas.

53
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:47,923
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

54
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:00,479
The satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test.

55
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:04,984
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

56
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:08,945
No, first the infrared.

57
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:15,453
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

58
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:19,457
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.

59
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:23,587
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

60
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:28,883
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

61
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:34,806
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

62
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:39,687
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

63
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:43,899
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

64
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:50,073
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

65
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:54,327
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

66
00:10:54,576 --> 00:11:00,333
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

67
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,587
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!

68
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:11,011
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us.

69
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,598
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.

70
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:21,022
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

71
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:25,819
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.

72
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,029
Are you crazy?

73
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:33,994
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

74
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:40,250
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

75
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,089
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

76
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:50,053
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

77
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:54,348
- of the greatest beast...

78
00:11:54,557 --> 00:12:00,314
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

79
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:05,611
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

80
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,784
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

81
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:19,042
- was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

82
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,877
And this strange warning:

83
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:28,635
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

84
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:33,306
- God preserve thee."

85
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:39,604
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

86
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:43,526
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

87
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:47,154
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.

88
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:50,199
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

89
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,577
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

90
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:56,914
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!

91
00:12:57,123 --> 00:13:01,919
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

92
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,049
He's got one of our T-shirts.

93
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:16,394
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

94
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,273
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...

95
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:27,654
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

96
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:32,035
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

97
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:38,542
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?

98
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:46,175
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

99
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:51,013
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

100
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:57,103
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

101
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,565
Let's go. Come on.

102
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:15,873
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!

103
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:20,168
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.

104
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:24,382
Come back here!

105
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:29,637
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

106
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:33,766
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

107
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,625
All stop.

108
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:34,372
She's alive!

109
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,973
Gently.

110
00:15:54,978 --> 00:16:00,107
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

111
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:03,026
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.

112
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:07,531
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

113
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,910
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.

114
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:24,925
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

115
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:29,888
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

116
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:36,729
C- Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

117
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,652
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?

118
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:53,372
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

119
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,834
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

120
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,381
I know just how to use him, too.

121
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:11,766
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

122
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:21,735
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?

123
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:25,864
What have you got, crystal balls?

124
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:29,118
There's nothing I haven't checked.

125
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:33,081
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

126
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,710
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

127
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:44,384
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.

128
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:49,681
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

129
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:20,380
Hello. Everything's fine.

130
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,177
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

131
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,017
Where's Harry and everyone?

132
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:44,279
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?

133
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,746
No. No.

134
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,505
Yeah...

135
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,095
I was on deck and then...

136
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:11,851
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.

137
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:15,604
Let her call it a star.

138
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:21,403
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

139
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:25,283
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

140
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:29,661
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

141
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:35,917
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

142
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:40,590
We're sorry, ma'am.

143
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,553
So am I.

144
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:51,059
Harry had discovered me.

145
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:58,400
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

146
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:01,737
Dumb luck.

147
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,327
But I guess I really can't complain.

148
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:14,666
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

149
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:20,005
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.

150
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:27,181
How can I ever thank you?

151
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:34,146
I'm Dwan.

152
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:42,613
D- W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

153
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:48,704
- except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

154
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:54,084
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.

155
00:20:54,334 --> 00:21:00,340
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

156
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,969
You need some rest.

157
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:09,307
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

158
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:16,064
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.

159
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:27,660
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

160
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:36,170
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

161
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,262
Oh, my God!

162
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,227
What a meaningful miracle!

163
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:56,857
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?

164
00:21:57,068 --> 00:22:00,235
I swear to God.

165
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,282
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

166
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:09,663
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

167
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:15,837
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

168
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:19,715
Come on, men, let her rest.

169
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:29,308
Maybe my luck has changed.

170
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,642
You know something?

171
00:24:28,894 --> 00:24:33,523
I always wondered how Cortes felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

172
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:37,569
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

173
00:24:57,381 --> 00:25:02,178
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

174
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:08,351
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

175
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:13,149
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

176
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:15,651
Let's get in closer.

177
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:21,449
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.

178
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:25,828
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?

179
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,915
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.

180
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:41,928
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

181
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:50,563
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

182
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:54,941
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

183
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,404
Wait a minute.

184
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:03,075
You said I could come
on the first boat.

185
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:06,954
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

186
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:10,958
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

187
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:15,297
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

188
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:19,009
- by "Deep Throat".

189
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:25,223
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

190
00:26:25,432 --> 00:26:29,561
- Printjust one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...

191
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:33,858
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

192
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:39,279
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

193
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,283
Ask your computer.

194
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:48,665
<i>I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18%% % interest plus charges.</i>

195
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:55,631
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

196
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,095
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

197
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:10,896
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

198
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:17,154
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

199
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:20,533
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.

200
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,911
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

201
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:28,791
- and meet the biggest person
in my life.

202
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:22,138
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

203
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,645
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.

204
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:32,024
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

205
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,118
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

206
00:28:58,427 --> 00:29:02,724
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

207
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,810
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

208
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,480
<i>In two words: No problem.</i>

209
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,383
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

210
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,354
That's good.

211
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:31,983
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

212
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:37,156
Wait, hold it. All right.

213
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:43,579
Beautiful.

214
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:54,425
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

215
00:30:54,632 --> 00:31:00,889
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

216
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:04,977
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

217
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:10,816
- Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
- All right, move out!

218
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:26,832
There's a waterfall ahead!

219
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,420
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

220
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:17,845
Don't go running off anymore.

221
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:22,392
We'll wait here for them.

222
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:29,482
Just stick close by me, OK?

223
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:57,658
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

224
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:04,166
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

225
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:10,589
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

226
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:15,053
Are you telling me
there's people here?

227
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,724
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

228
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:24,729
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.

229
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:31,194
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

230
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,907
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

231
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:40,703
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

232
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:45,501
Two: The island is uninhabited.

233
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,848
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

234
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,684
Let's go.

235
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:17,723
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

236
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,562
- What?
- Down there, that pool.

237
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:39,079
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.

238
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:42,249
It sure as hell could be oil.

239
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:48,131
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

240
00:37:08,568 --> 00:37:13,489
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.

241
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:18,369
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

242
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:25,420
Where's the groom?

243
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:38,182
See the one in the ape mask?

244
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:43,271
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

245
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:47,108
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

246
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,489
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

247
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:54,241
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

248
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:26,023
Oh, Christ!

249
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:35,577
You want to talk for us?

250
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:40,498
I'll try.

251
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:43,960
Shoot in the air only.

252
00:38:52,302 --> 00:38:55,221
What's he bitching about?

253
00:38:55,473 --> 00:39:01,146
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

254
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:26,546
No.

255
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:36,181
Remember, in the air.

256
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:01,250
What is it?

257
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:07,172
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

258
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,135
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

259
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:17,057
In the air!

260
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:48,028
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.

261
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,949
What have we got
that wogs go for?

262
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,872
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts ofjunk.

263
00:41:57,121 --> 00:42:02,252
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can'tjust grab their island.

264
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,422
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

265
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,717
- we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

266
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:11,804
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

267
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:14,307
Kong! Kong!

268
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:19,145
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

269
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:22,273
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

270
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:28,530
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

271
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,283
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

272
00:42:32,492 --> 00:42:36,163
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

273
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:39,208
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.

274
00:42:42,503 --> 00:42:49,468
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

275
00:42:52,012 --> 00:42:56,560
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

276
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:13,285
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...

277
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,375
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.

278
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:25,882
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.

279
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:31,096
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.

280
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:36,517
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

281
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:43,817
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

282
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:47,405
How did you know I was an Aries?

283
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,161
By the shape of your ears.

284
00:43:53,368 --> 00:43:58,957
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

285
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:05,216
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?

286
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:07,926
There's nothing else to do.

287
00:44:08,176 --> 00:44:11,180
Use your imagination.

288
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:17,813
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

289
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:32,244
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

290
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:39,001
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

291
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,088
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

292
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:49,262
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

293
00:45:23,255 --> 00:45:27,719
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

294
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,804
All right.

295
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:37,979
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

296
00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:44,027
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

297
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:48,824
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all."

298
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:55,372
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.

299
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:19,154
Help!

300
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:26,327
Help me!

301
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:39,550
No!

302
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:30,019
We're too late.
Set off the show.

303
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:16,693
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.

304
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:22,366
Get on the other side!
Pull!

305
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:30,208
Open that gate!

306
00:56:33,878 --> 00:56:38,925
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

307
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:09,875
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.

308
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:14,671
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

309
00:57:20,343 --> 00:57:24,473
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

310
00:57:24,681 --> 00:57:29,060
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

311
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,273
That's a footprint.

312
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:54,254
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

313
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:59,927
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.

314
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:05,141
Give me that thing.
Mostjungle apes eat only fruit.

315
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:09,604
Mostjungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

316
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:13,358
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

317
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:16,612
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

318
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:19,447
Keep moving.

319
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,247
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

320
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:30,166
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

321
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:34,713
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

322
00:58:34,965 --> 00:58:40,095
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?

323
00:58:43,014 --> 00:58:49,437
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

324
00:58:51,648 --> 00:58:56,903
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

325
00:58:57,154 --> 00:59:01,199
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

326
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:05,788
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

327
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:10,750
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

328
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:15,923
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank."

329
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:33,984
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

330
00:59:37,237 --> 00:59:42,117
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

331
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,661
What for?

332
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:49,417
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

333
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:55,090
- Is that some kind ofjoke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!

334
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,845
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

335
01:03:01,328 --> 01:03:04,497
I can't stand heights.

336
01:03:07,585 --> 01:03:14,633
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

337
01:03:20,974 --> 01:03:24,394
Put me down!

338
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:31,317
You put me down!

339
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:41,287
You put me down!

340
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:47,501
Put me down.

341
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:56,303
Please put me down.

342
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:14,487
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

343
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:19,202
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

344
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:26,417
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

345
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:31,005
Go ahead! Choke on me!

346
01:04:37,137 --> 01:04:42,184
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

347
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:47,565
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

348
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:57,200
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

349
01:04:58,784 --> 01:05:02,707
We're going to be great friends.

350
01:05:02,956 --> 01:05:09,588
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

351
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:14,759
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

352
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,346
I think that's just wonderful.

353
01:06:15,865 --> 01:06:18,869
Help me!

354
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,460
Help me!

355
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:19,266
Radar had him on the screen.

356
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:26,482
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

357
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:31,237
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

358
01:07:31,446 --> 01:07:36,074
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

359
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:39,412
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

360
01:07:39,662 --> 01:07:44,043
<i>- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.</i>

361
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,631
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.

362
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:54,720
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

363
01:07:54,969 --> 01:07:58,766
I know how you feel.

364
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:01,685
But there's an energy crisis.

365
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:06,565
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

366
01:08:06,774 --> 01:08:12,279
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.

367
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,950
Let's get going.

368
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:18,411
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

369
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:24,585
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

370
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:45,275
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...

371
01:10:45,483 --> 01:10:48,987
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

372
01:10:49,236 --> 01:10:53,616
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!

373
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:57,746
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

374
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:02,834
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

375
01:11:03,085 --> 01:11:07,298
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.

376
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:13,179
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

377
01:11:13,388 --> 01:11:15,807
How much longer?

378
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:22,062
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

379
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:29,487
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

380
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,410
Oh, my God!

381
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:39,832
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

382
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:45,213
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

383
01:11:48,549 --> 01:11:52,846
The big one. Jesus!

384
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,853
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

385
01:12:00,103 --> 01:12:03,857
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

386
01:12:20,959 --> 01:12:23,794
OK, Jack, you go first.

387
01:12:56,496 --> 01:13:02,085
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.

388
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,647
- Stop firing!
- Jack!

389
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:48,594
Boan! Try to make it back.

390
01:15:51,555 --> 01:15:54,809
I'm going on.

391
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:28,262
<i>All hands, stand by for recovery.</i>

392
01:16:47,364 --> 01:16:50,910
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.

393
01:16:51,118 --> 01:16:55,456
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.

394
01:16:55,664 --> 01:16:59,711
Get that equipment working.

395
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:02,547
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.

396
01:17:02,755 --> 01:17:08,094
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

397
01:17:08,303 --> 01:17:12,348
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

398
01:17:12,558 --> 01:17:18,314
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

399
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:25,905
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

400
01:17:26,112 --> 01:17:31,577
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".

401
01:17:31,786 --> 01:17:37,250
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

402
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:40,962
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

403
01:17:42,339 --> 01:17:47,594
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

404
01:18:20,337 --> 01:18:24,008
Give us a hand over here.

405
01:18:29,722 --> 01:18:33,851
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

406
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:38,231
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.

407
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:43,612
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.

408
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:49,410
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

409
01:18:49,618 --> 01:18:52,537
Don't worry about it.

410
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,963
Boan!

411
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:08,471
Where's the others?

412
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:52,183
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

413
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:58,064
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

414
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:28,139
Jack!

415
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,231
We've got to do it.

416
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:57,608
Are you ready?

417
01:24:24,638 --> 01:24:29,934
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

418
01:24:30,143 --> 01:24:35,482
<i>- heading 0-89,
velocity 2.2 miles per hour.</i>

419
01:24:35,691 --> 01:24:40,404
<i>Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or less.</i>

420
01:24:40,611 --> 01:24:44,617
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

421
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:58,715
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.

422
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:07,641
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!

423
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:14,815
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.

424
01:25:15,024 --> 01:25:20,195
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

425
01:25:21,907 --> 01:25:25,242
Pull back the bolt halfway.

426
01:25:32,376 --> 01:25:35,545
- Come on.
- I can't.

427
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,715
Open the gate! Help!

428
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:24,472
- Help!
- Jack!

429
01:26:26,058 --> 01:26:29,226
It's Prescott, open the gate.

430
01:26:46,078 --> 01:26:48,831
Come on!

431
01:27:03,054 --> 01:27:05,473
Close the bolt!

432
01:28:42,909 --> 01:28:46,788
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

433
01:31:41,306 --> 01:31:44,851
Still want to play?

434
01:31:46,811 --> 01:31:50,941
Dwan! Congratulations.

435
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,499
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

436
01:32:08,418 --> 01:32:13,214
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.

437
01:32:13,423 --> 01:32:16,343
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.

438
01:32:16,551 --> 01:32:22,516
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

439
01:32:22,724 --> 01:32:25,936
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

440
01:32:26,144 --> 01:32:31,568
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

441
01:32:33,485 --> 01:32:36,363
Any chance of you two
getting married?

442
01:32:36,573 --> 01:32:41,493
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

443
01:32:41,702 --> 01:32:47,083
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

444
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:57,428
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

445
01:32:57,636 --> 01:33:02,349
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

446
01:33:11,609 --> 01:33:14,028
Christ.

447
01:33:17,324 --> 01:33:24,038
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

448
01:33:31,463 --> 01:33:35,300
How can I become a star
because of someone -

449
01:33:35,508 --> 01:33:40,890
- that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

450
01:33:41,098 --> 01:33:47,522
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

451
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:52,318
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

452
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:55,280
He tried to rape you, honey.

453
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:59,784
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

454
01:33:59,993 --> 01:34:04,289
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.

455
01:34:04,498 --> 01:34:11,088
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

456
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:17,303
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

457
01:34:17,511 --> 01:34:21,766
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

458
01:34:25,728 --> 01:34:28,899
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

459
01:34:29,107 --> 01:34:32,110
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

460
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,031
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

461
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:41,204
- just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

462
01:34:41,412 --> 01:34:44,539
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

463
01:34:44,749 --> 01:34:49,211
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

464
01:34:54,258 --> 01:34:57,178
See you opening night.

465
01:35:09,984 --> 01:35:14,238
Oh, God, I'm tired of thinking.

466
01:35:26,584 --> 01:35:31,632
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?

467
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:45,292
Wait a minute.

468
01:36:48,671 --> 01:36:51,632
I'll be right back.

469
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,101
<i>All hands on deck!</i>

470
01:37:46,689 --> 01:37:50,611
<i>Fire detail,
report to the control room.</i>

471
01:37:54,241 --> 01:37:58,369
<i>This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.</i>

472
01:37:58,578 --> 01:38:03,208
<i>Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I"m ordering the ape drowned.</i>

473
01:38:06,711 --> 01:38:11,049
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

474
01:38:16,596 --> 01:38:21,352
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

475
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,605
You haven't forgotten, have you?

476
01:38:33,322 --> 01:38:38,495
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

477
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:42,874
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.

478
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:47,671
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.

479
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,424
OK.

480
01:38:53,051 --> 01:38:59,017
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

481
01:38:59,224 --> 01:39:04,522
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

482
01:39:13,616 --> 01:39:17,911
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

483
01:41:26,087 --> 01:41:28,883
You could've...

484
01:42:30,197 --> 01:42:34,159
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

485
01:42:37,121 --> 01:42:42,752
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.

486
01:42:42,961 --> 01:42:47,465
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

487
01:42:47,674 --> 01:42:53,013
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.

488
01:42:53,221 --> 01:42:56,140
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.

489
01:42:56,350 --> 01:43:01,814
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

490
01:43:02,022 --> 01:43:06,944
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.

491
01:43:07,153 --> 01:43:11,282
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.

492
01:43:15,202 --> 01:43:20,458
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

493
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:25,631
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

494
01:43:25,839 --> 01:43:29,801
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

495
01:43:32,262 --> 01:43:37,476
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...

496
01:43:37,684 --> 01:43:42,356
I do. Sorry.

497
01:43:44,984 --> 01:43:48,237
Stay well.

498
01:44:11,096 --> 01:44:14,933
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -</i>

499
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:18,978
<i>- you are seeing this
live around the world-</i>

500
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:24,858
<i>- as it is happening
here in New York City.</i>

501
01:44:25,069 --> 01:44:31,866
<i>You have better seats than these
lucky King Kong contest winners.</i>

502
01:44:53,013 --> 01:44:58,769
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

503
01:44:58,979 --> 01:45:02,356
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

504
01:45:02,566 --> 01:45:07,613
- to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

505
01:45:07,821 --> 01:45:11,784
Now the earth booms.

506
01:45:45,946 --> 01:45:51,158
Kong's power!
Superpower!

507
01:45:53,203 --> 01:45:56,414
Hail the power!

508
01:46:29,615 --> 01:46:35,080
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

509
01:46:47,092 --> 01:46:49,929
No! Don't push her around!

510
01:46:58,396 --> 01:47:02,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

511
01:47:02,442 --> 01:47:08,991
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

512
01:47:32,766 --> 01:47:36,853
Come on out! Easy.

513
01:47:37,062 --> 01:47:40,732
His feet are still chained.

514
01:47:42,192 --> 01:47:46,154
It's all right. Come on.

515
01:49:44,863 --> 01:49:47,365
We're in position.

516
01:49:47,575 --> 01:49:52,413
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

517
01:49:52,621 --> 01:49:56,793
<i>I"II tell that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.</i>

518
01:49:59,462 --> 01:50:02,758
Come on, there's a train coming.

519
01:52:04,344 --> 01:52:06,887
Hit the lights.

520
01:52:22,529 --> 01:52:26,701
<i>This is a message to all traffic.</i>

521
01:52:26,908 --> 01:52:30,870
<i>Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.</i>

522
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:38,546
<i>Repeating: Clear all streets. Any
person found looting will be shot.</i>

523
01:52:56,648 --> 01:52:59,526
Keep running.

524
01:52:59,735 --> 01:53:04,573
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

525
01:53:04,782 --> 01:53:07,702
Come on, buy me a drink.

526
01:53:07,909 --> 01:53:12,040
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

527
01:53:12,248 --> 01:53:15,168
We've put a river between us.

528
01:53:15,376 --> 01:53:19,796
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

529
01:53:20,007 --> 01:53:25,762
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

530
01:53:28,223 --> 01:53:30,559
OK.

531
01:53:33,936 --> 01:53:36,899
What's the matter?

532
01:53:37,107 --> 01:53:42,656
Déjà vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

533
01:54:17,148 --> 01:54:20,319
Here.

534
01:54:20,528 --> 01:54:24,324
We don't want to get shot as looters.

535
01:54:24,533 --> 01:54:28,912
OK, get smashed.

536
01:54:29,121 --> 01:54:34,168
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

537
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:43,136
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

538
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:48,390
I asked you a question.

539
01:54:48,599 --> 01:54:52,437
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?

540
01:54:52,645 --> 01:54:58,860
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

541
01:55:00,571 --> 01:55:05,326
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

542
01:55:05,534 --> 01:55:08,871
Don't be stupid.

543
01:55:46,202 --> 01:55:48,996
It's OK.

544
01:55:50,915 --> 01:55:56,379
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

545
01:55:56,587 --> 01:55:59,757
Do you remember that black-out?

546
01:55:59,967 --> 01:56:05,389
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

547
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:10,435
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

548
01:56:11,645 --> 01:56:14,690
I'll drink to that.

549
01:56:17,192 --> 01:56:23,950
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

550
01:56:25,744 --> 01:56:32,500
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

551
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:35,503
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

552
01:56:41,427 --> 01:56:45,473
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

553
01:56:58,737 --> 01:57:03,616
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

554
01:57:05,035 --> 01:57:08,788
Keep it down, everyone.

555
01:57:08,997 --> 01:57:13,001
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

556
01:57:13,209 --> 01:57:17,840
Hello? Hello...

557
01:57:18,048 --> 01:57:21,678
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

558
01:57:21,886 --> 01:57:25,514
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

559
01:57:25,723 --> 01:57:30,186
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

560
01:57:30,395 --> 01:57:35,691
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

561
01:57:35,901 --> 01:57:41,657
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

562
01:57:50,832 --> 01:57:55,129
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.

563
01:57:55,337 --> 01:57:57,839
Where is Kong heading?

564
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:03,722
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

565
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:08,267
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

566
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:50,521
Jack!

567
01:59:20,677 --> 01:59:25,642
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

568
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:31,731
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

569
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:16,528
No.

570
02:01:14,714 --> 02:01:17,425
Hold on! Close your eyes!

571
02:01:17,634 --> 02:01:21,889
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

572
02:02:06,936 --> 02:02:09,605
Hold on!

573
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,194
Kong...

574
02:04:06,312 --> 02:04:11,066
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

575
02:05:33,236 --> 02:05:35,865
The rotten bastards!

576
02:05:53,966 --> 02:06:00,391
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

577
02:06:21,287 --> 02:06:25,541
No! Don't put me down.

578
02:06:25,749 --> 02:06:29,546
Hold on to me.

579
02:06:31,966 --> 02:06:35,760
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

580
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:45,603
Now!

581
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,781
Oh, God.

582
02:07:11,465 --> 02:07:13,885
Wait.

583
02:07:21,726 --> 02:07:24,395
Hold on to me.

584
02:07:24,604 --> 02:07:28,524
Please don't let me go.

585
02:07:40,913 --> 02:07:43,290
Don't kill him!

586
02:07:45,959 --> 02:07:48,504
Don't kill him!

587
02:08:01,017 --> 02:08:03,852
Assholes!

588
02:09:09,255 --> 02:09:11,800
Kong.

589
02:11:00,706 --> 02:11:03,501
Dwan!

590
02:11:03,709 --> 02:11:06,421
Jack!

591
02:11:07,922 --> 02:11:11,009
Jack!
