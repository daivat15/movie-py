00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,338
Right, let's sort the buyers from the spyers,

2
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,882
the needy from the greedy,

3
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,551
and those who trust me from the ones who don't.

4
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,845
Because if you can't see value here today,

5
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,639
you're not up here shopping,
you're up here shoplifting.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,849
You see these goods?

7
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,477
Never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite

Take a bag.
Come on, take a bag.

10
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,190
I took a bag home last night,

11
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,400
and it cost me a
lot more than £10,
I can tell you.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,735
Anyone like jewelry?

13
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,073
Look at that one there.
Handmade in Italy,
hand stolen in Stepney.

14
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,575
It's as long as my arm.
I wish it was as long
as something else.

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,328
Don't think 'cause these boxes
are sealed up they're empty.

16
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,039
The only man who
sells empty boxes
is the undertaker.

17
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,916
And by the look of some of you lot here today,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,002
I'd make more money
with me measuring tape.
Here, one price.

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,712
£10.
Did you say £10?

BACON: Are you deaf?

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,298
That's a bargain.
I'll take one.

22
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,259
Squeeze in if you can.
Left leg, right leg,
your body will follow.

23
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,762
They call it walking.
You want one
as well, darling?

24
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,764
You do. That's it,
they're waking up.

25

Treat the wife, treat somebody else's wife.

26
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,519
It's a lot more fun if you don't get caught.

27

Hold on, you want one as well?

28
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,563
Okay, darling, show me a bit of life then.

29

like 1:00 half struck.

Buy them, you better buy them!

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,320
These are not stolen,
they just haven't
been paid for.

32
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,447
And we can't get them
again, they've changed
the bloody locks.

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,407
Here, one for you.
It's no good
coming back later

34
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,826
when I've sold out.

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,744
"Too late,
too late!"
will be the cry

36
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,830
when the man with
the bargains has
passed you by.

37
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,581
And if you've got no money on you now,

38
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,042
you'll be crying
tears as big as
October cabbages.

lies in cards
and gambling with cards.

You know how much it is, Nick.

No, that does not include the amp.

00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,560
Like fucking antiques.

317

Antiques?
What the fuck do we
know about antiques?

318
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,816
We rob
post offices.
And steal cars.

playing cards since
he could lift them up,

and he soon discovered
that he had
a big advantage.

335
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,256
It's not that he's good
with cards or even
good at counting them.

336
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,385
It's that he's good with
reading people's reactions,
no matter how subtle.

337
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,638

you're very much mistaken.

No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink.

Harry was going to start
sizing up all their
fingers in a week,

501
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,472
because he knew there was
no way Ed could settle
that debt on his own.

502
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:37,352
Harry saw it as their money
on the table, so it was also
their debt off the table.

503
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,229
Ed would hate admit it,

but he could have kissed
the old bastard for that.

505
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,777
If he said he wanted to
settle the debt on his own,
it would have been a lie.

506
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,907
Now, I wish to Christ he
would have let me settle
the debt on my own.

BACON: Once there was
this geezer called
Smithy Robinson

514
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,601
who worked for Harry,

515
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,270
but it was rumored that he was on the take.

516
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,231
Harry's invited
Smithy round for
an explanation.

517
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,693
Smithy didn't do
a very good job.
Within a minute,

518
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,947
Harry's lost his rag,
reached out for the
nearest thing at hand,

519
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,200
which happened to
be a 15-inch
black rubber cock.

520
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,621
He then proceeded to
batter poor Smithy
to death with it.

521
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,919
Now that was seen as a pleasant way to go.

is a man you pay

00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,742
PLANK: Well enough.

624
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,494
I've been buying gear
off one of them for
a couple of years.

625
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,912
So, what are they like then?

626
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,666
Poofs. Nothing heavy.
Four public schoolboys.
Soft as shite.

627
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,191
PLANK: They ponce around
in funny hippy clothes
all day, talking bollocks.

628
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,193
They're just good at growing weed, that's all.

629
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,529
Business has got bigger
than what they
can keep up with.

630
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,531
DOG: Well, they
can't all be stupid,
can they?

631
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,619
Think about it.
They've got a container
load of cash in shoeboxes.

632
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,245
They're selling
class-A gear.

633
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,207
Don't you think there
might be someone
sensible involved?

634
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,333
What about security?

635
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,044
PLANK: There's one steel
gate as you go in, but
they never lock it.

636
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,545
What do you mean, never lock it?

637
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,838
What have they got it there for then?

638
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,257
I must have been
there 50 times.
It's never locked.

639
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,717
They're not suspicious.

640
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,344
Everyone who goes there's a toff.

641
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,096
They're all into that karma crap.

642
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,140
"If I don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

643
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,642
No way they can get back to you?

644
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,728
Even if they could,
they'd be too shit scared.
I'm a geezer.

645
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,481
They got no muscle.
Gutless faggots.

646
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,317
Fancy one?

647
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,695
What's all the flapping about?

648
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,239
You told the old man yet?

649
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,199
Hoping I won't need to.

650
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,786
I've got a plan.
Now listen carefully.

651
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,549
Hello, boys.

652
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,758
Harry.

653
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,427
Do you want a drink?

654
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,179
Hello, my son, do you want a lolly?

655
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,014
Piss off, you nonce.

656
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,766
Oi ! Watch it.

657
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,145
No thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

658
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,980
Nice shooter.

659
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,356
Yeah, one of a pair.

660
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,359
Holland & Holland.
Do you want
to hold it?

661
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,528
No, not my thing.
Thanks, Harry.

662
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,281
Business good?
I imagine that's
why I'm here.

663
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,742
Four young fellas
got in deeper than
they could handle.

664
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,786
They owe me half a million pound.

665
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,580
LITTLE CHRIS:
How much?

666
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,039
Half a million.

667
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,043
I'm game.

668
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,130
Me, too.

669
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,966
Oh, God.

670
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,634
Right.

671
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,305
We hit them as soon as they come back.

672
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,515
We'll be prepared, waiting.

673
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,852
And they're armed.

674
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,729
What was that?
Armed?

675
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,814
What do you mean, armed?

676
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,316
Armed with what?

677
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,486
Bad breath,
colorful language,
feather duster. ..

678
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,778
What do you think they're gonna be armed with?

679
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,113
Guns, you tit.

680
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,575
Guns? You never
said anything about guns.

681
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,244
A minute ago this
was the safest job
in the world.

682
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,663
Now it's turning into a bad day in Bosnia.

683
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,041
Soap, stop being such a mincer.

684
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,210
I've thought
about that and. ..

685
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,336
And what exactly?

686
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,299
And all we have to
do is find out
who's carrying them.

687
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,178
Carrying them? Well,
they could all be carrying
them for what we know.

688
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,556
No. Only one of
them carries them
going to the job.

689
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,267
So I assume the same one will be carrying them

690
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,560
when they come back from the job.

691
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,479
Oh, you assume, do you?

692
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,565
And what do they say
about assumption being the
brother of all fuck-ups?

693
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,067
It's the mother
of all fuck-ups, stupid.

694
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,861
Well, brother, mother, any other sucker,

695
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,530
it don't make any difference.

696
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:19,202
They're still fucking
guns, and they still
fire fucking bullets.

697
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,038
Soap, if you have a better idea

698
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:26,960
how to get £500,000
in the next few days,
let us know.

699
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:33,341
In the meantime, Tom,
you talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

700
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,558
Weed?
No, it's not
normal weed.

701
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,394
It's some
fucked-up-skunk,
class-A,

702
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,312
I-can't-think-let-alone-move
shit.

703
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,189
Doesn't sound very good me.

704
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,317
No, neither me.
But it depends
what flicks your switch.

705
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,571
And the light is on
and burning brightly
for the masses.

706
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,906
Anyway, do you know anyone?

707
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,116
I know a man, yes.

708
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,369
Rory Breaker.

709
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,372
Not that madman with an Afro?

710
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,332
I don't want anything to do with him.

711
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,252
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

712
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,296
No can do.

713
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,300
What's that?
A place near Katmandu?

714
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,467
Meet me halfway, mate.

715
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,137
Look, it's all completely chicken soup.

716
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,848
It's what?
It's kosher
as Christmas.

717
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,684
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.

718
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,437
Yeah, well, never
mind that. I'm gonna
need some artillery, too.

719
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,188
Couple of
sawn-off shotguns.

720
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,941
This is a bit heavy.
This is London,
not the Lebanon.

721
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,776
Who do you think I am?

722
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,403
I think you're Nick the Greek.

723
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,281
Hold those two.

724
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,244
I don't normally have
anything to do
with weed, Nick.

725
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,496
But if it is what he says it is,

726
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,541
I'll take it off him
for 3.5 grand a key.

727
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,127
That is if it is what he says it is.

728
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,838
I don't want to see it after a sample,

729
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,174
I don't want to touch it after a sample.

730
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,385
I'll leave you in
the capable hands
of Nathan here.

731
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,721
He'll sort out the details.

732
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,348
But just let me tell you one thing.

733
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,980
If the milk turns out to be sour,

734
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,982
I ain't the kind of pussy to drink it.

735
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,071

Rory? Yeah,
I know Rory.

739
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,624
He's not to be underestimated.

740
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,501
He's a funny looking fucker, I know.

741
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,504
But you've got to look
past the hair and the
cute cuddly thing.

742
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,714
It's all a deceptive facade.

743
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,761
A few nights ago, Rory's Roger iron rusted.

744
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,973
He's gone down the
Battle Cruiser to watch
the end of a football game.

745
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,519
No one's watching
the custard, so he
switches the channel over.

746
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,771
A fat geezer's north opens.

747
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,066
And he wanders up and turns the liza over.

748
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,944
"Now fuck off
and watch it
somewhere else."

749
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,156
Rory knows claret is
imminent, but doesn't wanna
miss the end of the game.

750
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,660
So calm as a coma,
picks up a
fire extinguisher,

751
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,621
walks straight past
the jam rolls who are
ready for action

752
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,707
and plonks it outside the entrance.

753
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:15,044
He then orders an Aristotle
of the most ping-pong
tiddly in the nuclear sub

754
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,380
and switches back to his footer.

755
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,508
"That's fucking it," says the geezer.

756
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,760
"That's fucking what?"
says Rory.

757
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,805
And he gobs out a
mouthful of booze
covering Fatty.

758
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,391
He flicks a flaming match into his bird's nest,

759
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,394
and the geezer's lit up like a leaking gas pipe.

There was a couple of
old hammer-lock muskets
the butler was carrying.

778
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,696
But they were ours, we sold them.

779
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,865
Well, you better unsell them, sharpish.

780
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,658
We had to sell them.
We needed the money!

781
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,077
I'm not fucking interested!

782
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,831
If you don't want to be
counting the fingers
you haven't got

783
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,001
I suggest you get those guns, quick!

784
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,630
Jesus.

785
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,800
If I pick them up, will they stay in one piece?

786
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,635
Where'd you get them?

787
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,804
I got contacts.

788
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,014
Listen, Tom, you point them at me,

789
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,183
I'll shit myself or do whatever you say to do.

790
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,893
Either way you get the desired effect.

791
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,604
Oh, they look very nice, I agree,

792
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,898
but they're lacking
in criminal credibility,
ain't they?

793
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,400
I might get laughed at.

794
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,068
How much do you want for these muskets?

795
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,278
£700 each.

796
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,197
What's that?
A pound for every year
they've been about?

797
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,993
I know they're antiques,
but I ain't paying
antique prices.

798
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,622
They're a bit long, ain't they?

799
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,626
Sawn-offs are out.
People want a bit more
range these days.

800
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,712
Range?

801
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,131
I don't want to blow
the arse out of this
country, granted.

802
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,467
But I don't want anyone
blowing a raspberry
at me, either.

803
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,553
I want to look fucking mean.

804
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,930
Of course you'll look mean.

805
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,223
You'll look really scary.

806
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,433
Anyway, enough about that.

807
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,310
What about this geezer who sells drugs?

808
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,770
Rory Breaker's standing by.

809
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,024
You stand to make a lot of money, tubby Tommy.

810
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,115
BIG CHRIS: I understand
if this has come as
a bit of a shock,

811
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,411
but let me tell you how
this can be resolved by
you, the good father.

812
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,871
Go on.

813
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,165
He likes your bar.

814
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,666
Yes?

815
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,668
He wants your bar.

816
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,629
And?

817
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,299
Do you want me to draw you a picture?

818
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,761
Look, that boy doesn't
know his arsehole
from his ear hole.

819
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,764
This is my bar.
It's got nothing to
do with him.

820
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,016
What, and I care?

821
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,602
Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage

822
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,938
of being able to sustain your son's life.

823
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:06,192
And you do have a
reputation, so I'll choose
my words very carefully.

824
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,195
You tell Harry to go fuck himself.

825
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,618
Now,

826
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,458
I'll put that
down to shock.
Only once.

827
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,463
Only once can I
or shall I let you get
away with that.

828
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,509
Your son's got three days to find half a mil.

829
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,471
But make up your mind which you prefer,

830
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,224
your bar or your son.

831
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,731
DOG: Plank goes in first.

832
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,775
There's a cage, but it's never locked.

833
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,568
DOG: Is it, Plank?
Never.

834
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,736
DOG: It don't wanna be.

835
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,157
All right, once he's got
himself set, he gets
the rest of us in.

836
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,243
(FEEDBACK SCREECHING)
Now we get nasty
with a couple of them.

837
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,411
Shit them up, gag them, whatever.

838
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,998
Now these wankers
shouldn't give us
any problems.

839
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,334
But like any cowboys,
there'll be a few
tools lying around.

840
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,130
When the job's done,
we come straight back
here and unload.

841
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,924
And Robert's your father's brother.

842
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,884
Everyone savvy?

843
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,386
ALL: Sweet.

844
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,888
Have a look at these.

845
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,101
And what are we supposed do with these?

846
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,688
Put them on your head, stupid.

847
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,148
Christ.

848
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,901
If you think I'm gonna
turn up there clean-shaven
and greet them

849
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,779
with a grin on
my face, you got
another thing coming.

850
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,531
Now these fellas, they're your neighbors.

851
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,577
I thought it might be
a good idea to disguise
ourselves a little.

852
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,456
Right. Yeah, good
thinking, Soap.
Well done.

853
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,250
I brought weapons as well.

854
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,794
Weapons? What do
you mean, weapons?

855
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,088
(CLEARS THROAT)

856
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,673
These.

857
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,508
(EXCLAIMING) Jesus.

858
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,094
Let's keep them covered up, eh?

859
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,557
Couldn't you have got anything a bit bigger?

860
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,560
What, like that?

861
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,896
What do you think?

862
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,648
I think you need help.

863
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,778
Bar steward, can
we have a couple
of drinks, please?

864
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,865
Have you seen
your dad? Hatchet sent
one of his men around.

865
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,326
Oh, shit. When?

866
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,079
Crazy. ..

867
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,927
Where did you
get these?
A fucking museum?

868
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,553
Nick the Greek.

869
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,307
How much did you part with?

870
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,809
£700 for the pair.

871
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,519
Drachmas, I hope.

872
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,605
I'd feel safer with a chicken drumstick.

873
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,441
These are gonna do more harm than good.

874
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,946
Jesus, Tom, do these work?

875
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,781
Don't know.
Look nice though,
don't they?

876
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,865
I rather like them.

877
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,951
That's top of the list of priorities, that is.

878
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,202
EDDIE: Ladies,

879
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,372
back to more
important issues,
if you don't mind.

880
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,791
We have only got two real guns.

881
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,793
Apparently, that's what they are.

882
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,129
So we find a good place to hide next door,

883
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,005
we wait till it sounds like the right time,

884
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,340
then we
jack-in-the-box,

885
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,176
look nasty and stuff,
cocoon them
in gaffer tape,

886
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:23,722
nick their van, swap the
gear into the new van and
bring it all back here.

887
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,600
As long as we're
all out of our hiding
places quickly,

888
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,061
it's the last thing they're gonna expect.

889
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,438
Oh, and if Tom or anyone else for that matter

890
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,274
feels like giving them a bit of a kicking,

891
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,568
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

892
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,321
Yeah, little bit of pain never hurt anybody,

893
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,489
if you know what I mean.

894
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:45,119
Also, I think knives are a good idea.

895
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,663
Big, fuck-off,
shiny ones.

896
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,250
Ones that look
like they could
skin a crocodile.

897
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,420
Knives are good
because they don't
make any noise.

898
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,838
And the less noise they make,

899
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,174
the more likely we are to use them.

900
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,509
Shit them right up.

901
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,428
Makes it look like we're serious.

902
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,890
Guns for show, knives for a pro.

903
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,811
Soap, is there
something we should
know about you?

904
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,147
I'm not sure what's more worrying,

905
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,773
the job or your past.

906
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,612
Come on, girls.

907
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,128
Where the fuck
are they going?
Shift a piano?

908
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,714
I thought this was meant to be a robbery.

909
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,008
Where did they get those outfits?

910
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,635
BOTH: Not a
bad idea, that.

911
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,013
All right,
it's Plank. Is
Willie there?

912
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,724
No. I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

913
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,559
PLANK: Perhaps
you can help.

914
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,771
Well, perhaps
I can't, Plank, if you
know what I mean.

915
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,940
Look. If you
could just
open the door,

916
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,608
so I could talk without shouting.

917
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,652
J: I can't help
you, Plank.

918
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,738
I think you'll find it is in your interest.

919
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,323
Hold on, okay?

920
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,742
Look, Willie, it's Plank outside for you.

921
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,369
He says it's in our interest.

922
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,413
Listen, I don't
care if it's
King-fucking-Kong!

923
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,791
He's not coming in here, not today.

924
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,294
Hold on. We are
in business, and
correct me if I'm wrong,

925
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,421
but that is business.

926
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,133
Corrected. That's a
walking accident that
we can do without.

927
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,887
Jesus, he's okay.
He knows only to
buy weights now.

928
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,890
We're looking at at least a couple of thou.

929
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,017
What do you think, Winston?

930
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,938
Willie, this is the last time, all right?

931
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,107
But you and the money are going out the back.

01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,216
How are we doing, Tom?

1089
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,759
Right as rain.

1090
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:52,053
I'm just gonna take care of the cabs.

1091
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,597
Keep us posted.

1092
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:00,228
All right, mate, do you do airports?

1093
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,692
Where the hell are we gonna hide?

1094
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,363
Don't complicate
things. Just hide.

1095
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,170
We're on.

1096
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,022
Cor, they weigh a pound or two.

1097
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,690
Shut up and back up!

1098
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,150
(WHISTLES)

1099
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,527
Spin round, big boy.

1100
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,407
What the fuck?

1101
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,868
Stay down.
Stay down!

1102
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,628
Tie them up, tape them up, hands and face.

1103
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,296
On the floor!

1104
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,049
Bend over the fucking desk.

1105
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:19,307
Keys. I want
keys. Now!

1106
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,978
I'll find you.

1107
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,355
Course you will, sweetheart.

1108
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,898
I'll find you.

1109
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,068
What do you think
this is, fucking
hide-and-seek?

1110
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,529
That one.
Search that one.

1111
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:47,043
Right, I'll see you
in the van when you've
finished with handsome here.

1112
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,022
Jesus, that wasn't too bad, was it?

1113
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:15,196
When the bottle in my
arse has contracted,
I'll let you know.

1114
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,824
Bacon, see what we've got.

1115
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,326
Let's have a butchers, eh?

1116
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,459
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

1117
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,671
We've got God knows
how much of this
stinking weed,

1118
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,591
a shit load of cash

1119
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,219
and a traffic warden.

1120
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,345
What?

1121
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,100
Jesus, Ed, we got a traffic warden.

1122
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,063
I think he's still alive.

1123
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,982
He's got claret coming out of him somewhere.

1124
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,734
What did they want with a traffic warden?

1125
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,944
I don't know, but I don't think we need him.

1126
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,030
Knock him out and dump him at the lights.

1127
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,573
Knock him out?
What do you mean,
knock him out?

1128
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,699
Knock him out with what?

1129
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,243
I don't know!
Use your imagination!

1130
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,123
(GROANING)

1131
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,459
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out!

1132
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,086
I'll knock you out in a minute.

1133
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,712
Look, you want to knock him out,

1134
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,255
you knock him out.

1135
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,592
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

1136
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,148
It's about time you
gave my young
friends a visit, Chris.

1137
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:38,113
Tomorrow's the day and mum's the word.

1138
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,906
Now I can't have that, can I, Baz?

1139
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,950
No, Harry, you can't.

1140
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,952
I mean, it's a liberty.

1141
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,622
And I can't have a liberty taken, can I, Chris?

1142
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,541
No, Harry, you can't.

1143
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,211
I mean, it's enough to give me the arsehole.

1144
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,215
And I can't have the arsehole, can I, boys?

1145
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,342
BOTH: No, Harry, you can't.

1146
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,226
EDDIE: Right, that's it.
We're done.

1147
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,271
We're off.
Here, Ed.

1148
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,398
Are you sure it's
a good idea taking
this back to yours?

1149
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,774
Well, it's the only place we can take it,

1150
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:15,942
and it's the last place they're gonna look.

1151
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,026
Anyway, fuck it!

1152
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,862
The battle is over and the war is won.

1153
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,614
Now, Tom.
You take this
to Nick the Bubble,

1154
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,283
then we get rid of it quick.

1155
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,549
It's skunk, and it's as good as it gets.

1156
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:44,679
All right, we'll take it.

1157
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,139
Half price.

1158
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,017
I don't think he'll like that.

1159
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:52,520
You said 3.5 a key,
and you know that's
a good price.

1160
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,439
It was yesterday I said three and a half,

1161
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,900
and now it's today if I'm not mistaken.

1162
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,652
We'll take it tomorrow, half price.

1163
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,238
If he wants to get rid of it quick,

1164
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,364
he'll have to take it.

1165
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,449
Now look,

1166
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,117
I've got a race coming up in a minute,

1167
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,120
so if you'd just be
kind enough to. ..

1168
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,548
Lenny, take that round
to Snow White and
the three little chemists.

1169
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,550
They should have a gander of that.

1170
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,636
I want a second opinion.

1171
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,726
LENNY: Hang on
a minute, Nathan.
Something stinks.

1172
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,020
NATHAN: Yeah, your
fucking aftershave.

1173
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,939
LENNY: Fuck you,
funny man.

1174
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,983
For God's sake.
Help me.

1175
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:43,071
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much
pain ! Jesus.

1176
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,739
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1177
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:46,866
Fuck you, funny man, you go first.

1178
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,202
Just get the fuck in there, will you?

1179
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,912
I want this house searched for bugs.

1180
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,455
I mean, I want it stripped.

1181
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,706
Where's the point in that?

1182
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,084
Even if there was a
bug, they'd have
taken it with them.

1183
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,419
It's a bit late
for you to start
thinking, John.

1184
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,089
If it's a possibility,
that's good
enough for me.

1185
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,674
And when you've stripped this place,

1186
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:07,136
I want every slag this
side of Ceylon pulled in
and tortured badly.

1187
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:09,931
I want to know who's responsible for this.

1188
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:13,101
Otherwise, I'm gonna hold you responsible.

1189
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,235
EDDIE: Not a bad day.

1190
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,863
That pile takes care of Harry.

1191
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,783
What's left over?

1192
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,035
Give me half a chance to count it.

1193
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:34,831
What about this gear then, eh?

1194
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,298
What, you want a toke on that?

1195
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,550
No, I don't think
I want any of that
horrible shit.

1196
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:48,428
Can we lock up and get drunk now, please?

1197
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:54,267
We shot one of them in the throat.

1198
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,393
What do you want, a medal?

1199
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:59,480
I'll shoot you in the
fucking throat if I don't
get my ganja back.

1200
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,443
RORY: The one you
shot, is he still
in there now?

1201
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,944
No, it was another one.

1202
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,404
That's more like it.

1203
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,239
Where is he?

1204
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,075
Well, they took him with.

1205
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,619
No, he's still alive.

1206
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,831
What did you
shoot him with?
An air gun?

1207
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:26,716
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1208
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,761
You don't say.

1209
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,679
Who could it be?

1210
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,514
Where do we start, Rory?

1211
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,849
Mr. Breaker.

1212
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,519
Today my name
is Mr. Breaker.

1213
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,481
You think this is a coincidence?

1214
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:43,316
This white shite steals my things

1215
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,360
and thinks that he can sell it back to me!

1216
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:47,987
He's got less brains than you, Lenny!

1217
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,031
Get Nick,

1218
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:54,952
the greasy wop. ..
Greek bastard
round here now.

1219
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,206
If he's still
stupid enough to be
on this planet.

1220
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,460
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

1221
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:34,469
Your stupidity might be your one saving grace.

1222
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,636
Uh?

1223
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,847
Don't "uh" me, Greek boy!

1224
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:41,100
How is it your
fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1225
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,811
thought that they
might be able to
steal my cannabis,

1226
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,938
and then sell it back to me?

1227
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,065
Is this a declaration of war?

1228
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,527
Is this some white
cunt's joke that
black cunts don't get?

1229
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:55,072
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing, Nicolas!

1230
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,868
I know you couldn't have known my position,

1231
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:01,496
'cause you're not that stupid that if you did,

1232
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,831
you wouldn't have
turned up here
scratching your arse

1233
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,833
with that, "What's going on here" look

1234
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,336
slapped all over your Chevy Chase.

1235
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:13,758
But what you do know is where these people live.

1236
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:23,017
If you hold back anything, I'll kill you.

1237
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:25,561
If you bend the truth,
or I think you're
bending the truth,

1238
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,021
I'll kill you.

1239
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:29,190
If you forget anything, I'll kill you.

1240
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:33,236
In fact, you're gonna
have to work very hard
to stay alive, Nick.

1241
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:36,822

It's not worth him giving us any trouble,

And they were gonna pay?

1395
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,002
Looks like it, but who knows?

1396
01:26:57,086 --> 01:26:58,545
The opportunity was there.

1397
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,715
In my experience,
it's best to take
that opportunity

1398
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,300
if it's there.

1399
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:05,928
Good work, Chris.

1400
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:14,937
DEAN: We've got to
get those guns.

1401
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,689
This is dangerous
shit, Dean. We don't even
know who lives there.

1402
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,524
Listen, I don't care who lives there!

1403
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:23,153
All's I know is that
it's preferable to
death by Hatchet.

1404
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,780
GARY: Fair enough.

1405
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:26,156
Let's go.

1406
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,182
I don't think it's the right move.

1407
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:56,561
It's either that,
the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1408
01:27:57,897 --> 01:27:59,648
I'm gonna phone him.

1409
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:00,774
As if he'll care.

1410
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:03,777
He'll care all right.
That was supposed
to be his money.

1411
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:06,113
Whether he cares about us or not is different.

1412
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:07,864
Pass me the phone.

01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:24,923
Yeah?

01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,717
That you, boy?

It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

Pay day, isn't it?

1418
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,349
Yeah. I wanted to
talk to you
about that.

1419
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,268
I'll bet you do.

1420
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:38,478
I've got half-a-million
nickers sitting here,

You've been upsetting a few people, boy.

1423
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:47,279
But that really isn't my concern, is it?

1424
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:50,741
What does concern me is the guns you had.

1425
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,702
And I want to talk to you about that.

1426
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:57,247
So get your arse
over here now,
and I do mean now.

Where's what I want?

1435
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:16,910
You all right down there, mate?

1436

I've just left it in the office.

1439
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:24,918
We better go to the office and get it then.

1440
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,421
That's if you want
your son to see
his next birthday.

Where are you going?

It's a 30-second
drive or a five-minute
walk.

1445
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,809
And I couldn't have parked outside.

1446

I'd have got a ticket.

Right.

You and me.
You and who?

1451
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,537
You know where the door handle is, Tom.

That's it. I'm off.

Tom, that is our bag.

Hold on.

01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:23,703
This is our bag.

take these guns.

Tom, don't fuck about!

1460
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:31,920
I'll see you in the car.

1461
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,214
Tom.
It'll only take
a minute.

What is going on?

1463
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:56,278
I don't know.
But what I do know is
there's no more Harry,

1464
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:59,739
which means there's no more debt.

1465
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:03,201
And if there's no
more debt, there's no
more problem.

1466
01:33:03,452 --> 01:33:07,289
And there's no problem
with the neighbors,
because they're all dead.

1467
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,125

we haven't done
anything wrong,
and we're in the clear.

Cheeky bastard.

embarrassing position
for Tom to be in.

1477
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,554
But Chris had to respect the fact

1478
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,350
that he was holding what
appeared to be a pair
of loaded shotguns.

1479
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:53,436
And Tom had to respect
the fact that they
were not loaded.

1480
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:56,981
So, without anybody losing too much face,

1481

Tom left through a side door,
and Chris left with the money.

So,

01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:03,084
the only thing connecting us with the case

1524
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,421
is in the back of
your car, which is
parked outside?

1525
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:10,425
They cost us 700 quid.
I'm not gonna
throw them away.

1526
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:14,178
And they're hardly
likely to trace them
back to us, are they?

1527
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:17,348
Do you really think
it's worth taking
the risk for £700?

1528
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,183
Tom, you're a dick.

1529
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:23,104
Now you take those guns,
and you throw them
off a bridge.

1530
01:38:23,188 --> 01:38:25,231
And throw yourself off while you're at it.

1531
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,317
Now, Tom.

I'm busy.
Get it yourself.

1535
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:04,938
It seemed Hatchet underestimated you lot,

1536
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:07,231
and it seems to have cost him.

1537
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:11,361
Well, I ain't gonna
make the same
mistake now, am I?

01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,702
I think the word you're
looking for, gentlemen,
is "thank you."

01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:21,996
Thank you.

1541
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:25,959

I've lost my employer.

1543
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:33,383
So I've taken care of meself and me son.

1544
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,302
Now if you think that's unfair,

1545
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,763
you come and pay me a little visit.

1546
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:40,807
But you better be waving a white flag

1547
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:43,559
high and clear, so as I can see it.

1548
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:48,189
Or it'll be the
last little visit
you ever make.

1549
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:50,400
You understand?

1550
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:54,529
That's all I've come to say.

1551
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,616
There is one more thing.

1552
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:02,829
It's been emotional.

1553
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:33,568
We are now officially
in the money-lending
business.

1554
01:40:33,652 --> 01:40:35,153
You all right, Son?

1555
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,488
Put your seat belt on.

1556
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:39,449
We're out of here.

1557
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,542
It's empty.

1558
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:03,199
ALL: What's his number?

1559
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:12,250
Don't, don't!
You'll jam the line!
I'll call him.

1560
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,967
My fucking battery.

1561
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:22,593
Oh, you. ..
Give me
the phone!

1562
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,303
No, fuck off!
I'll dial it!
Give me the phone!

1563
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:27,640
Just be calm for a minute.
All right, shut up and tell
me the number!

1564
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:38,776
Fuck you!
Give me
your phone!

1565
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:41,529
You'll break it!
Just calm down!
Give me the phone!

1566
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:48,077
Look, you'll
break it, and it'll be
fucked, won't it?

1567
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,746
Will you shut?
It's fucking ringing!

1568
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,711
