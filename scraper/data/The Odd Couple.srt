00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,650
The dehumidifier. Fellas, I asked you.
Don't play with this thing.

748
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,778
I'm trying to get some of the grime
out of the air. Gee whiz.

749
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,906
Murray, I'll give you $200 for your gun.

750
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:34,494
I can't take it anymore. In the last three hours,
we've played four minutes of poker.

751
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,497
I'm not giving up Friday nights
to watch cooking and cleaning.

752
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,042
I can't breathe. That lousy machine
is sucking everything out of the air.

753
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,879
- This is delicious. Who wants a bite?
- I didn't have supper. Is the toast warm?

754
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,341
Perfect. And not too much mayonnaise.
It's really a well-made sandwich.

755
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,718
Cut me off a little piece.

756
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,053
Give me your napkin.
I don't wanna drop crumbs.

757
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:54,472
Martha and Gertrude at the Automat.

758
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,685
That thing could kill us. They'll find us
in the morning with our tongues on the floor.

759
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,812
Do something. Get him back into the game.

760
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,774
Don't come to me with your petty problems.
You get this one stinking night a week.

761
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,028
I'm cooped up here with Mary Poppins
24 hours a day.

762
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,946
Felix, get in here, will you?

763
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,948
FELIX:
Coming.

764
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,660
It was better before,
with the garbage and the smoke.

765
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,746
- Did you notice what he does?
- What?

766
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,665
He cuts off the crusts.
That's why the sandwich is so light.

767
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,668
And only uses the soft green part of the lettuce.
It's really delicious.

768
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,921
- I'm going out of my mind.
- Felix, will you get in here?

769
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,507
- I'm not gonna ask again.
- Forget it. I'm going home.

770
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,802
The day his marriage busted up
was the end of our poker game.

771
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,305
Speed, you can't run out now.
I'm a big loser.

772
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,016
You got no one to blame but yourself.
It's your fault.

773
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,602
You're the one who stopped him
from killing himself.

774
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,231
He's right. That man is absolutely right.

775
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,443
- You gonna eat that pickle?
- I wasn't thinking of it. You want it?

776
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,780
- Unless you want it. It's your pickle.
- I don't usually eat pickles.

777
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,907
- Deal the cards.
- What did you do that for?

778
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:57,535
You wanna play poker, deal the cards.
You wanna eat, go to a delicatessen.

779
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,746
Keep your pickles
and sandwiches to yourself.

780
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,749
I'm losing $53 here,
and everybody's getting fat.

781
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,501
- Felix!
- What?

782
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:08,546
Close the stinking restaurant and sit down.
We got a poker game going on here.

783
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,717
Is it up to me...?
Who threw a pickle on my floor?

784
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:13,927
I don't think that's funny.

[ROY SNIFFING]

786
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,057
What is that smell? Disinfectant?

787
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,270
It's the cards. He washed the cards.

788
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,776
- I'm getting out of here. I can't stand any more.
- Wait a minute, Roy. Where you going?

789
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,738
I've been sitting here breathing cleaning fluid
and ammonia for three hours.

790
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,617
Nature didn't intend
for poker to be played like that.

791
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,162
Okay, ready to play.

792
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,082
- Good. We got just enough for handball.
- Where is everybody?

793
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,669
You got the nerve to ask that question?
I just been sterilized out of $53.

794
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,421
Well, I'm sorry. Is it my fault, fellas?

795
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,090
Aw, no.
I guess no one feels like playing tonight.

796
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,509
I'd better be going too. Gotta get up early.

You always do things like that together?

We have to. I don't know how to drive.

- You coming, Murray?
- Yeah. Why not?

802
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:11,151
I gotta stop off and get Mimi a hero sandwich
and a frozen éclair.

sure got the life, huh, Vinnie?

00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,866
Yeah. Some life those playboys got.

Well, they don't know.

They just don't know what it's like
living alone, do they?

811
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,972
I'd be immensely grateful to you, Felix,
if you didn't clean up just now.

00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,100
Just a few things. But playboys, us.

Ha, ha. That's really funny.

Well, they should only know.

Will you leave everything alone, please?

Don't you see the irony of it? Huh?

817
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,489
Don't you see the irony?

818
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:01,534
- Yes, I see it.
- I don't think you do. I don't think you see it.

819
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:06,623
- Felix, I'm telling you, I see the irony of it.
- Then tell me, what is it? What's the irony?

820
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,084
The irony is that unless we come
to some other arrangement...

821
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,962
...I'm gonna kill you. That's the irony of it.

- What's wrong, Oscar?
- There's something wrong with this system.

823

I don't think that two single men living alone
in a big eight-room apartment...

824

...should have a cleaner house
than my mother.

825

Wait. What are you talking about?
I didn't say that you have to clean up.

826
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,564
What you do is worse.
You're always hanging up my towels.

827
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,733
You follow me around with an ashtray.

828
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:38,279
Last night I found you washing the floor
and moaning, "Footprints, footprints."

829
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,781
I didn't say they were yours.

830
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,534
Well, they were mine.
I have feet, and they make prints.

You want me to climb across the cabinets?

832

No, I just want you to walk on the floor.

Oh. Well, I appreciate that. I really do.

I want them uneven. They're my pictures.

838
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,886
Even up your own pictures.

Oh. Heh, heh.
I was wondering how long it would take.

How long what would take?

00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:09,894
Before I got on your nerves.

842
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,399
I didn't say you got on my nerves.
Please don't do that.

- Same thing. You said I irritated you.
- No, you said you irritated me. I didn't say it.

844
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,489
- What did you say?
- I don't remember. What's the difference?

845
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:25,076
Doesn't make any difference.
I was just repeating what I thought you said.

846
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,912
Don't repeat what you thought I said.
Repeat what I said.

847
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,664
My God, that's irritating.

848

You see? You did say it.

Oscar, I'm sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

Don't pout. You wanna fight, we'll fight,
but don't pout.

Fighting, I win. Pouting, you win.

You're right. You're right.

854
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,765
Everything you say about me is right.

855
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,144
Don't give in so easily. I'm not always right.
Sometimes you're right.

856
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,646
You're right. I do that.
I always figure I'm wrong.

857
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,441
- This time, you are wrong and I'm right.
- Leave me alone.

858
00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:01,696
- And don't sulk. That's the same as pouting.
- I know, I know.

Oh, damn me.

Why can't I do just one lousy thing right?

861
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,791
Why didn't you throw it?

862
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,336
I almost did.
Sometimes I get so insane with myself.

863
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,880
- Then why didn't you?
- I'm trying to control myself.

864
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,758
- Why are you trying to control yourself?
- What do you mean?

865
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,886
You were angry. You felt like throwing the cup.
Why didn't you?

866
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,680
Because I would still be angry
and I'd have a broken cup.

867
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,224
How do you know how you'd feel?
Maybe you'd feel wonderful.

868
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,519
Huh? Why do you have to control
every thought that comes into your head?

869
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,812
Why don't you let loose?

870
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,733
Do something that you feel like doing,
not what you think you're supposed to do.

871
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,985
Stop controlling yourself, Felix.

872
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,237
Relax. Get drunk. Get angry.

873
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,658
Come on! Break the lousy cup!

874
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,744
Ow! I hurt my arm.

875
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:53,456
You're hopeless.
You're a hopeless mental case.

876
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,292
I shouldn't throw with that arm.
I've got bursitis.

877
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,920
Why don't you live in a closet?

878
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:02,256
I'll leave your meals outside the door
and slide in the newspapers.

879
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,593
Oh, cut it out. I hurt easily.
That's the way I am. I can't help it.

880
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,428
You're not gonna cry, are you?

881
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:11,557
I think all those tears dripping on your arm
is what gave you bursitis.

882
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,399
Let me tell you something, Oscar.

883
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,527
I may not be the easiest person
in the world to live with...

884
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:26,030
...but you could've done a lot worse.
A whole lot worse.

885
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,367
How?

886
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,536
I put order in this house.

887
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,080
For the first time in months,
you're saving money.

888
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,625
You're sleeping on clean sheets,
you're eating hot meals for a change...

889
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,293
...and I did that.

890
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,379
Yes, that's right.

891
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:46,551
Then at night, after we've had

01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:56,341
I've come for Felix's things.

1622
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:07,894
- You mean my Felix?
- Oh, yes. Yes. Felix Ungar.

1623
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:11,022
That sweet, tortured man
who's in my flat at this moment...

1624
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:13,316
...pouring his heart out to my sister.

CECILY:
Gwen?

1626
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:18,947
Gwen. Felix doesn't want to stay.
Please tell him to stay.

1627
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:22,659
Please, girls, this is embarrassing.
I can go to a hotel. How are you, Vinnie?

1628
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:24,995
GWENDOLYN:
Nonsense. There's plenty of room on the sofa.

1629
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:26,997
I'll be in the way. Won't I be in the way?

1630
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:30,625
- How could you possibly be in anyone's way?
- Wanna see a typewritten list?

1631
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:32,294
Haven't you said enough already?

1632
01:41:32,462 --> 01:41:35,297
- Please. Please. Just for a few days?
- Until you get settled.

1633
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:38,925
- Please say yes.
- Oh, please. We'd be so happy.

1634
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:43,013
- Well, maybe just for a few days.
- Oh, that's marvelous.

1635
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:45,015
Good. Then get the rest of your things.

1636
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:47,184
- We'll go clean the house.
- And cook dinner.

1637
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,645
GWENDOLYN: It'll be so nice to have a man
about the house again. Come on, Cecy.

1638
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:53,648
Good night, gentlemen.
So sorry to interrupt your bridge game.

- Huh?

01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:32,103
Felix, are you really
gonna move in with them?

1649
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,773
Just for a couple of days,
you know, until I can get my own pad.

- For what?

1652
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:41,571
The two greatest things I've ever done for you.
Taking you in and throwing you out.

[FELIX CHUCKLES]

Oscar, you're right. Getting thrown out twice
is enough for any man.

In gratitude, I remove the curse.

It's your wife.

Do me a favor, Murray.
Tell her I can't talk to her right now.

01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:06,888
Tell her I'll call in a couple days.
We have a lot to talk about.

1664
01:43:07,056 --> 01:43:08,890
Tell her if I sound different to her...

1665
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:11,810
...it's because I'm not the same man
she threw out three weeks ago.

Yeah, I got a good idea why you're calling.
You got my checks, right?
