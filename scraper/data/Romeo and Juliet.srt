1
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:30,987
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

2
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:37,493
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,

3
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:42,498
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

4
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:48,004
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

5
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:52,300
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

6
00:00:54,093 --> 00:01:00,016
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,

7
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:05,480
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,486
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.

9
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,501
(laughing)

10
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:34,509
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.

11
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,803
Ah, 'tis all one.

12
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:38,513
(laughing)

13
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:41,808
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

14
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,020
Ah, good morrow.

15
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:47,897
Good morrow
to you, sir.

16
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:50,983
Quarrel,
I will back thee.

17
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,485
Right.

18
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,195
Fail me not.

19
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:07,500
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,503
I do bite
my thumb, sir.

21
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:15,508
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

22
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:18,011
No, sir.

23
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:21,014
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,

24
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:23,516
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.

25
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,018
Do you quarrel, sir?

26
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:30,481
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.

27
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:32,984
If you do, sir,
I am for you.

28
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,986
I serve as good
a man as you.

29
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:35,987
No better?

30
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,281
Yes, better, sir.

31
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:44,495
You lie.

32
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,005
(laughing)

33
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,509
Draw!

34
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,219
Draw if you be men!

35
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,096
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!

36
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,890
(shouting)

37
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,519
Kill the Capulets!

38
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:10,480
(shouting)

39
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:26,496
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!

40
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:28,498
You know not what you do!

41
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,500
The Prince hath
expressly forbid

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,585
this bandying
in Verona streets!

43
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,504
Here come the Capulets!

44
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:40,009
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,397
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

46
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:57,985
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.

47
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,487
I do but keep the peace.

48
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:00,988
Put up thy sword

49
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:03,408
or manage it
to part these men with me.

50
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,202
What, drawn
and talk of peace?

51
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:07,704
I hate the word,

52
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:12,208
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.

53
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,793
Have at thee, cowards!

54
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,586
Capulet!

55
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:17,005
Montague!

56
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,298
(shouting)

57
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,509
Capulet!

58
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,186
Now hie thee home,
fragment.

59
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:34,605
You villain!

60
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,986
Capulet!

61
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:41,988
(shouting)

62
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:48,619
Give me my long sword! Ho!

63
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:49,996
Capulet!

64
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,497
Down to the market square!

65
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,499
Capulet!

66
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,294
Follow me! Follow me!

67
00:04:56,294 --> 00:05:00,006
Kill that villain Montague!

68
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:05,386
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!

69
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,180
What?

70
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:10,391
My sword! My sword!

71
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:14,395
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!

72
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,399
Hold me not!
Let me go!

73
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,401
Montague!

74
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:21,986
Montague!

75
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,488
Kill the villain!

76
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,498
(shouting)

77
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,385
(woman screams)

78
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:51,307
I'll strike thee, coward.

79
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:04,404
(trumpet fanfare)

80
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,116
The Prince!

81
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,410
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!

82
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:12,704
The Prince!

83
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,914
The Prince!

84
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,585
Here comes the Prince!

85
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,796
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!

86
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:32,890
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,

87
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,518
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...

88
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:37,311
Down with your weapons.

89
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:42,817
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.

90
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:51,492
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,

91
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:52,994
by thee, old Capulet...

92
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,704
No, no.

93
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,585
And Montague...

94
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,880
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

95
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,386
If ever you disturb
our streets again,

96
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:14,390
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

97
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:19,896
For this time
all the rest depart away!

98
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:25,985
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.

99
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,488
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

100
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:38,915
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.

101
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,416
(trumpet fanfare)

102
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,518
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

103
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:01,979
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.

104
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,399
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun

105
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,984
peered forth
the golden window of the east,

106
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,405
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:

107
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:12,907
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore

108
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,118
so early walking
did I see your son.

109
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:19,914
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,

110
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,916
and stole into
the cover of the wood.

111
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,882
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.

112
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,889
See, where he comes.

113
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,983
So please you, step aside.

114
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:50,486
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

115
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,489
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,

116
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:54,991
to hear true shrift.

117
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:57,493
Come, madam. Let's away.

118
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,402
Good morrow, cousin.

119
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:38,284
Is the day so young?

120
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,119
But new struck nine.

121
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,412
Ay me!

122
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:44,999
Sad hours seem long.

123
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:53,508
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

124
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:55,009
Hmm?

125
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,511
It was.

126
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:06,604
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

127
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:13,611
Not having that, which having
makes them short.

128
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,781
Hmm. Hmm!

129
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:18,491
But, Romeo...

130
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,618
Farewell, Coz.

131
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,498
(shouting)

132
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,002
(woman screaming)

133
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,007
God's me,
what fray was here?

134
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,508
Yet tell me not,

135
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,511
for I have heard it all.

136
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:46,019
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

137
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:49,814
Soft, I will go along.

138
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:58,489
But Montague is bound
as well as l,

139
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:01,492
in penalty alike,

140
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,494
and 'tis not hard, I think,

141
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:06,998
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.

142
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:07,999
Oh...

143
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,501
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,

144
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:14,005
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:

145
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:18,009
but, but now, my lord,

146
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,011
what say you to my suit?

147
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:23,014
But saying o'er what
I have said before,

148
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:27,185
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.

149
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,981
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

150
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,319
(laughing)

151
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,489
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,

152
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,407
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.

153
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:44,202
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.

154
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,995
(chuckling)

155
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:56,005
And too soon marred
are those so early made.

156
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,008
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,

157
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:02,011
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

158
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:05,515
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,

159
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:09,018
my will to her consent
is but a part.

160
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,521
Oh, Peter!

161
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,982
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast

162
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:17,485
whereto I have invited
many a guest.

163
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:20,488
Such as I love,
you among the store,

164
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:23,491
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.

165
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,292
Nurse,
where's my daughter?

166
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,503
Call her forth to me.

167
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,505
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

168
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,007
I bade her come.

169
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,510
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!

170
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,681
Where is the girl?
Juliet!

171
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:51,019
Where is the girl? Juliet!

172
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,479
How now, who calls?

173
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,606
Your mother!
Your lady mother!

174
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:10,496
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.

175
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,498
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.

176
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:14,292
Where were you?

177
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:20,506
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

178
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:23,009
This is the matter.

179
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:27,513
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.

180
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:28,598
Nurse, um...

181
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,392
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.

182
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,986
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.

183
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:45,490
Thou's hear our counsel.

184
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:47,492
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

185
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,494
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

186
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:50,912
She's not fourteen.

187
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,914
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.

188
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,916
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,

189
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,918
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

190
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,586
How long is it
to Lammastide?

191
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:00,380
A fortnight and odd days.

192
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,799
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

193
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:04,801
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

194
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:06,302
Susan and she--

195
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:08,805
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.

196
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:11,307
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

197
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,184
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve

198
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,395
at night
shall she be fourteen.

199
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,605
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.

200
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,317
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!

201
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,903
Nay, I do bear a brain.

202
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,406
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.

203
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:29,409
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,

204
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,412
for even the day before
she broke her brow;

205
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:36,290
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--

206
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,792
took up the child.

207
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:41,421
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

208
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:44,298
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

209
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,383
wilt thou not, Jule?"

210
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,385
Nurse!

211
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,886
And by my holiday,

212
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:51,389
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."

213
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,682
(laughing)

214
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:58,396
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.

215
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,982
Yes, madam.

216
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:04,694
Now, Juliet.

217
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,320
(laughing)

218
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:08,781
God mark thee to His grace

219
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:12,285
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.

220
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,287
And I might live to see
thee married once,

221
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,289
I have my wish.

222
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:22,795
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.

223
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,088
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,

224
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:27,300
how stands your disposition
to be married?

225
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,393
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

226
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,896
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,

227
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,815
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.

228
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,401
Well, think
of marriage now.

229
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,404
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,

230
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:49,906
are made
already mothers.

231
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:52,408
By my count
I was your mother

232
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:55,411
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

233
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,913
Oh, yes, I remember.

234
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:59,707
Thus then, in brief...

235
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,710
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

236
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,799
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--

237
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:09,801
Why he's a man of wax.

238
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:11,803
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

239
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,805
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.

240
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:15,306
Shh.

241
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,311
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

242
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,690
Madam! Madam!

243
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,817
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,

244
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,985
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!

245
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,279
We follow.

246
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:34,409
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

247
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:39,914
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

248
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:43,418
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

249
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:46,421
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

250
00:16:49,882 --> 00:16:52,885
Juliet, the county stays.

251
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:54,387
Madam, I come.

252
00:16:55,888 --> 00:17:00,893
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.

253
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,311
(music playing)

254
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,280
(singing)

255
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:26,586
Give me a case
to put my visage in;

256
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,588
a visor for a visor.

257
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:33,301
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.

258
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:36,804
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.

259
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,389
Ahh!

260
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:42,810
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

261
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,896
Or shall we on
without apology?

262
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,689
The date is out
of such prolixity.

263
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,608
Let them measure us
by what they will.

264
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:50,902
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.

265
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,905
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,

266
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,700
but every man
betake him to his legs.

267
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:00,411
And we mean well in
going to this masque,

268
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,788
but 'tis no wit to go.

269
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,581
Why, may one ask?

270
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:07,794
I dreamt a dream tonight.

271
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,587
Ho, and so did I.

272
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:13,216
Well, what was yours?

273
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:16,594
That dreamers often lie.

274
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:21,307
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.

275
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:24,894
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

276
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,605
Queen Mab?

277
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:33,194
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.

278
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,821
(laughter)

279
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,280
And she comes in state

280
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,783
no bigger than
an agate stone

281
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,785
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

282
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,080
drawn with a team
of little atomies

283
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:47,417
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

284
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,380
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;

285
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,883
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

286
00:18:55,883 --> 00:19:00,388
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;

287
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:06,310
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;

288
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:08,813
her whip, crack!

289
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:12,900
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;

290
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,319
and in this state

291
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,989
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

292
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:21,492
and then they dream of love,

293
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:25,997
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

294
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,502
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

295
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,505
because their breaths
with, er,

296
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,007
sweetmeats tainted are.

297
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,510
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

298
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:42,513
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

299
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:47,685
and dreams he
of another benefice.

300
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:51,481
(all) Amen.

301
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,107
(laughter)

302
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,902
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

303
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,403
and then dreams he

304
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,907
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

305
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:04,118
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

306
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,620
at which he starts and wakes;

307
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,082
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...

308
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,589
and sleeps again.

309
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,591
This is that very Mab

310
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,594
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,

311
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:25,598
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,

312
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:29,185
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

313
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,606
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

314
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,110
that presses them
and learns them first to bear

315
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:41,614
making them women
of good carriage.

316
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,408
This is she...

317
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:46,619
This is she that...

318
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,415
This...is she.

319
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,091
Peace, Mercutio, peace.

320
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,593
Thou talk'st of nothing.

321
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:07,098
Thou talk'st of nothing.

322
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,310
True.

323
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,606
True, I talk of dreams;

324
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:19,610
which are the children
of an idle brain...

325
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:25,616
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

326
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:30,079
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

327
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,082
and more inconstant
than the wind

328
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:36,586
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,

329
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:40,590
and being angered
puffs away from thence,

330
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:43,593
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.

331
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:52,101
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

332
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:56,105
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.

333
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,691
(music playing)

334
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:00,109
(singing)

335
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,489
Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.

336
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,993
I fear too early...

337
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,081
For my mind misgives...

338
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,584
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

339
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:21,589
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date

340
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,092
with this night's revels,

341
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,095
and expire the term
of a despised life

342
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,098
closed in my breast,

343
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:35,103
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.

344
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,604
(bell tolling)

345
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,611
But he that hath
the steerage of my course...

346
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,615
Direct my sail.

347
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:56,582
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.

348
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:01,587
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.

349
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,507
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.

350
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,510
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!

351
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,012
Welcome, gentlemen.

352
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:11,514
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor

353
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:14,017
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,

354
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,601
such as would please.

355
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:18,604
'Tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen.

356
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:21,607
Ladies, ho, ho!

357
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,109
(music playing)

358
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:05,480
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

359
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,318
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

360
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,488
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,

361
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:19,118
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

362
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,582
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,

363
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:29,212
as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.

364
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,386
Did my heart love till now?

365
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,014
Forswear it sight,

366
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:44,394
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

367
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,279
This by his voice
should be a Montague.

368
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:07,000
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;

369
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,002
a villain that is
hither come in spite,

370
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,004
to scorn at
our solemnity this night.

371
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,588
Young Romeo is it?

372
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,008
Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,

373
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,884
to fear and scorn
at our solemnity?

374
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:19,012
'A bears him like
a courtly gentleman;

375
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,014
and to say truth,
Verona brags of him

376
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,016
to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.

377
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,018
I would not for the wealth
of all this town

378
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,020
here in my house
do him disparagement.

379
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,397
Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.

380
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,983
The Moureska!

381
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,484
The Moureska!

382
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:34,986
(jingling)

383
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,502
(laughs)

384
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,798
(music plays)

385
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,998
Why, Uncle,
'tis a shame!

386
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,499
Go to.

387
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:14,002
You are a saucy boy.

388
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,504
You'll make a mutiny
among my guests!

389
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,007
Am I the master here,
or you?

390
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,508
I will not endure him.

391
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,719
You will not endure!
He shall be endured!

392
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,220
Or I know what!

393
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,017
Well said, my hearts.

394
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:39,986
You're a princox.

395
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,196
Be quiet or...

396
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,199
Ah.

397
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,998
For shame!
I'll make you quiet.

398
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,609
Leonardo will sing!

399
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,195
Leonardo, I pray thee, sing.

400
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,793
What is a youth?

401
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,588
Impetuous fire

402
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,592
What is a maid?

403
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,887
Ice and desire

404
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,391
The world wags on

405
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,895
A rose will bloom

406
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:42,316
It then will fade

407
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,779
So does a youth

408
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:55,788
So does the fairest maid

409
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,083
Comes the time

410
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,585
When one sweet smile

411
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:06,090
Has its season for a while

412
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:12,013
Then love's in love with me

413
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,892
Some may think only to marry

414
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,520
Others will tease and tarry

415
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,899
Mine is the very best parry

416
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,694
Cupid he rules us all

417
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,281
Caper the caper,
sing me the song

418
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,785
Death will come soon
to hush us along

419
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,288
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

420
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:41,000
Love is a pastime
that never will pall

421
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,004
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

422
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:50,885
Cupid he rules us all

423
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:14,492
A rose will bloom

424
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:18,579
And then will fade

425
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:25,503
So does a youth

426
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:35,179
So does the fairest maid

427
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:41,019
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

428
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,479
this holy shrine,

429
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,691
the gentle sin is this;

430
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:52,905
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand

431
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:59,787
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

432
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,206
Oh.

433
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:22,518
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much

434
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,481
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

435
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,985
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch

436
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,990
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

437
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,994
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

438
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,998
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

439
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,500
Oh...

440
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,504
O then, dear saint,

441
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:54,008
let lips do
what hands do...

442
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:04,519
They pray,
grant thou,

443
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,979
lest faith
turn to despair.

444
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,981
Saints do not move,

445
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,983
though grants
for prayers' sake.

446
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,986
Then move not...

447
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,993
While my prayer's
effect I take.

448
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:29,502
Thus from my lips,
by thine,

449
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,214
my sin is purged.

450
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,020
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

451
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,980
Sin from my lips!

452
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,982
O trespass sweetly urged!

453
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,985
Give me my sin again.

454
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,491
A rose will bloom

455
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,786
It then will fade

456
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:09,917
So does a youth

457
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:22,889
So does the fairest maid

458
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,982
Juliet!

459
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,693
Lady Juliet!

460
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,403
Nurse?

461
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,198
Your mother craves
a word with you.

462
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,703
Make haste, make haste!

463
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,001
What is her mother?

464
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,503
Hmm.
Merry, bachelor,

465
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,506
her mother is
the lady of the house,

466
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,509
and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;

467
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,011
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

468
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,096
Hmm.

469
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,979
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her

470
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,482
shall have the chinks.

471
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,988
Is she a Capulet?

472
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,492
Ah, dear account!

473
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,787
My life is my foe's debt.

474
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,712
What, ho, my mistresses?

475
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,505
What, will you be gone?

476
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,008
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.

477
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,301
We'll call it early,
by and by.

478
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,595
Good night,
sweet, my Lady Juliet.

479
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,019
Come hither, nurse.

480
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,021
Hmm?

481
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,605
What is yon gentleman?

482
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,982
Count Paris.

483
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,610
No. What's he
that follows there?

484
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,406
Oh! I know not.

485
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,491
Go, ask his name.

486
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,997
Hmm. Romeo, of
the house of Montague.

487
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,582
What?

488
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,585
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague;

489
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,296
the only son of
your great enemy.

490
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:30,016
My only love sprung
from my only hate,

491
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:34,979
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

492
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,483
Oh!

493
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,486
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me

494
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,405
that I must love
a loathed enemy.

495
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,500
Juliet!

496
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,002
My Lady Juliet!

497
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,506
Madam!

498
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,802
Romeo!

499
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,598
Juliet!

500
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,520
Romeo!

501
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,106
Lady Juliet!

502
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,983
Juliet!

503
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:25,113
Romeo!

504
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,991
(horn blows)

505
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,493
Romeo!

506
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,495
Romeo!

507
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,497
(laughter)

508
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,500
Romeo!

509
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,003
Romeo!

510
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,587
Romeo!

511
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,007
Romeo!

512
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,010
Romeo!

513
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,513
1, 2, 3.

514
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:56,019
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

515
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,520
He is wise,

516
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,690
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.

517
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,983
He leaped
this orchard wall.

518
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,192
Call, good Mercutio.

519
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,485
Romeo!

520
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,697
(whistles)

521
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,699
Romeo! Passion! Lover!

522
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,285
O-hooo! Madman!

523
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,704
O-hooo! Romeo!

524
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,791
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.

525
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,418
The ape is dead.

526
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:26,299
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

527
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,010
Romeo, it's all right.

528
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,720
(dog barking)

529
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,890
But soft,

530
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:38,102
what light through
yonder window breaks?

531
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,200
(bell ringing)

532
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,798
It is my lady,

533
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:11,886
oh, it is my love.

534
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,805
Oh...

535
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,392
O that she knew she were.

536
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,895
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.

537
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,106
What of that?

538
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,404
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.

539
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,407
I am too bold,

540
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,410
'tis not to me she speaks.

541
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,914
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

542
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:43,418
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

543
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,380
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

544
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,508
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

545
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,012
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

546
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,597
that I might touch
that cheek.

547
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,184
Ay me!

548
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,311
She speaks.

549
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,112
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.

550
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:15,908
O Romeo, Romeo,

551
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,412
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

552
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:24,500
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

553
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:28,504
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

554
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,882
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

555
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,383
Shall I hear more,

556
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,385
or shall I speak at this?

557
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,387
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

558
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,183
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

559
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,520
What is Montague?

560
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:51,486
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face

561
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,406
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

562
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,618
O be some other name.

563
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,580
What's in a name?

564
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,083
That which we call a rose

565
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,211
by any other name
would smell as sweet;

566
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,798
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

567
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,384
retain that dear perfection

568
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,387
which he owes
without that title.

569
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,890
Romeo, doff thy name,

570
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,893
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

571
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,020
take all myself.

572
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,109
I'll take thee
at thy word.

573
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,111
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

574
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,406
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

575
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,909
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night

576
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,619
so stumblest
on my counsel?

577
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:45,498
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

578
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,417
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

579
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,793
because it is
an enemy to thee.

580
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,713
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

581
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,884
My ears have not yet drunk

582
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,887
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

583
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,889
yet I know the sound.

584
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:05,018
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

585
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,520
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

586
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,314
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

587
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,817
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

588
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,194
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

589
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,780
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

590
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,407
With love's light wings

591
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,409
did I o'er perch
these walls,

592
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,911
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

593
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,914
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

594
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,708
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

595
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,792
Sshhh!

596
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,881
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

597
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:39,385
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

598
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,388
And but thou love me...

599
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,184
Let them find me here

600
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,187
my life were better
ended by their hate,

601
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:52,607
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

602
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,403
Dost thou love me?

603
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,615
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;

604
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,116
yet if thou swearest,

605
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,493
thou mayst prove false;

606
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:07,997
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.

607
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,291
O gentle Romeo,

608
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:15,505
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

609
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,299
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

610
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,886
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

611
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:25,306
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.

612
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:30,520
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...

613
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,984
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.

614
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,193
No.

615
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,988
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

616
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,115
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

617
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,495
I should have been
more strange,

618
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,997
I must confess,

619
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,000
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

620
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,502
my true love's passion;

621
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,506
therefore pardon me,

622
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,509
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

623
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,387
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

624
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:08,016
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.

625
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,018
Oh, swear not by the moon,

626
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,519
th'inconstant moon,

627
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,982
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

628
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:20,111
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

629
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,613
What shall I swear by?

630
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,615
Do not swear at all.

631
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,995
Or if thou wilt...

632
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,997
Swear by thy gracious self,

633
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,000
which is the god
of my idolatry,

634
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,502
and I'll believe thee.

635
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:41,591
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...

636
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,509
Oh, Juliet!

637
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:02,987
Sweet, good night.

638
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,491
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath

639
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:10,495
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

640
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:21,714
Good night, good night.

641
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,218
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

642
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,221
as that
within my breast.

643
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,604
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

644
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,401
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

645
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:45,279
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

646
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:46,990
Ahh.

647
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,503
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

648
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,297
And yet I would it were
to give again.

649
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,011
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?

650
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,304
For what purpose, love?

651
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:15,309
But to be frank
and give it thee again.

652
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:24,986
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,

653
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,989
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

654
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,490
my love as deep.

655
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,493
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

656
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,495
for both are infinite.

657
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,997
Juliet!

658
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,498
Anon, good nurse!

659
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,002
Sweet Montague, be true.

660
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,504
Madam!

661
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,507
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

662
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,010
Madam! Lady Juliet!

663
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,687
O blessed, blessed night!

664
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,317
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

665
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,486
all this is but a dream,

666
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:08,988
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

667
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,992
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

668
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,995
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,

669
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,498
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

670
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,000
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

671
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:24,003
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

672
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,506
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

673
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,217
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

674
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,510
Madam!

675
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,596
I come, anon.

676
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,016
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--

677
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,184
Lady Juliet!

678
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,519
By and by I come!

679
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,689
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

680
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,190
Tomorrow will I send.

681
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,901
So thrive my soul.

682
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:49,612
A thousand times
good night!

683
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,993
Romeo!

684
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:57,787
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

685
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:58,997
At the hour of nine.

686
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,999
I will not fail.

687
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,292
'Tis twenty years
till then.

688
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:05,586
Romeo!

689
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,514
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

690
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,018
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

691
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:23,604
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

692
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,814
remembering how
I love thy company.

693
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,316
And I'll still stay,

694
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,318
to have thee
still forget,

695
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,321
forgetting
any other home but this.

696
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,614
Ahh.

697
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,884
(rooster crowing)

698
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:01,392
Good night, good night!

699
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,979
Parting is
such sweet sorrow

700
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,191
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

701
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,109
Woo!

702
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,511
Woo!

703
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,689
Friar Laurence!

704
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,484
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

705
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,486
Good morrow, father!

706
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,488
Ha ha ha!

707
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,990
Hey!

708
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,788
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

709
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:30,291
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

710
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,418
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure

711
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:34,420
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

712
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:37,882
Or if not so,
then here I put it right

713
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,385
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

714
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,596
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

715
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,890
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

716
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,393
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.

717
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:51,396
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

718
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:52,897
That's my good son.

719
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,899
Well, where hast
thou been then?

720
00:53:54,983 --> 00:53:57,402
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.

721
00:53:57,485 --> 00:53:59,904
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

722
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:02,281
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

723
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,410
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

724
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,495
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

725
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,416
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,

726
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,918
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

727
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:17,380
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

728
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,882
and all combined,
save what thou must combine

729
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,884
by holy marriage.

730
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,886
When and where,
and how we met,

731
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,389
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

732
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:27,807
I'll tell thee as we pass.

733
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,392
But this I pray,

734
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,686
that thou consent
to marry us today.

735
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:33,896
Hmmm?

736
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,107
Holy Saint Francis!

737
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,401
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,

738
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:39,902
so soon forsaken?

739
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,904
Thou doest not mock me, Father!

740
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:44,907
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

741
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,409
but in their eyes.

742
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,910
Hear me, Father.

743
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,912
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

744
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,415
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!

745
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,916
And art thou changed?

746
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,418
Pronounce this
sentence then.

747
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,379
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.

748
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,882
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.

749
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,884
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

750
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:06,095
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.

751
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,098
Not in a grave
to lay one in,

752
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:10,683
another out to have.

753
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:28,409
Come, young waverer,

754
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,912
come, go with me.

755
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:34,916
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

756
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,417
O Father!

757
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:40,380
For this alliance
may so happy prove

758
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:42,882
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

759
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,384
O, let us hence!

760
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,386
I stand on sudden haste.

761
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:47,887
Shh! Wisely and slow,

762
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,890
they stumble
that run fast.

763
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,392
Ha ha ha!

764
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:53,893
Shh!

765
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:00,400
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

766
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:01,901
Hmm?

767
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:05,279
Came he not home tonight?

768
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,782
Hmm?

769
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:09,283
Huh?

770
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:11,285
Came he not home tonight?

771
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,286
Who?

772
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:13,496
Romeo.

773
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:17,291
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

774
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,919
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

775
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:22,880
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

776
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,384
A challenge, on my life.

777
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,885
Romeo will answer it.

778
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,888
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

779
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,891
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

780
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,893
how he dares,
being dared.

781
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,396
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;

782
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,898
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

783
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,901
run through the ear
with a love song;

784
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,904
the very pin
of his heart cleft

785
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:49,907
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.

786
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,912
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

787
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,790
Why, what is Tybalt!

788
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,586
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.

789
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:08,718
Ah, good morrow
to you both.

790
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:13,806
(sniff)

791
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,309
That we should be
thus afflicted

792
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:18,811
with these
strange flies,

793
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:20,897
these fashionmongers,

794
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:24,400
these pardonnez moi's.

795
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,902
Ah, Signor Romeo,

796
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:27,403
Bonjour.

797
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,905
Bonjour.

798
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:31,407
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

799
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:32,909
Huh?

800
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:35,411
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

801
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:37,413
What counterfeit
did I give you?

802
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:39,415
The slip, sir, the slip,

803
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:40,792
can you not conceive?

804
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:42,210
Pardon, good Mercutio.

805
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,586
My business was great--

806
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:44,921
Oh! Ha ha ha!

807
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:46,881
In such a case as mine

808
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,383
a man may strain courtesy.

809
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:49,884
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

810
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,386
my wit faints.

811
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,388
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting

812
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:54,889
it is most sharp sauce.

813
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,891
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

814
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:58,393
Ha ha ha!

815
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,395
Why, is not this
better now

816
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,605
than groaning for love?

817
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:05,316
Now art thou sociable,

818
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,318
now art thou Romeo;

819
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,821
now art thou
what thou art,

820
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:12,782
by art as well as
by nature.

821
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,284
For this driveling love
is like a great natural

822
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,786
that runs malling
up and down

823
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,788
to hide his bauble
in a hole.

824
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:20,289
Stop there,
stop there.

825
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:23,292
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

826
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:25,294
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

827
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,879
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

828
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:30,383
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

829
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:32,510
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.

830
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,308
Here's goodly gear.

831
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:40,810
(laughter)

832
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:43,604
Here's a fine barge.

833
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:44,814
A sail.

834
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,816
(all)
A sail, a sail.

835
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,818
(laughter)

836
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:56,492
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.

837
00:58:56,492 --> 00:58:58,286
(laughter)

838
00:58:58,411 --> 00:58:59,787
Shh!

839
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:00,788
Peter.

840
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:03,207
Anon.

841
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,418
My fan, Peter.

842
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,003
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,

843
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:09,213
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

844
00:59:09,297 --> 00:59:11,090
Ha ha ha!

845
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,717
Oh!

846
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,304
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.

847
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:18,598
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.

848
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,183
Is it good den,
I pray?

849
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,810
Well, 'tis no less
I tell you,

850
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,104
for the bawdy hand
of the dial

851
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:27,106
is now upon the prick
of noon.

852
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,816
Ha ha ha! Oh!

853
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:31,486
Out upon you,
what a man are you?

854
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:35,281
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

855
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,284
By my troth
it is well said,

856
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:40,787
for himself to mar
quoth 'a?

857
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:42,288
Hmm.

858
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:45,291
Gentleman, can any
of you tell me

859
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,001
where I may find
young Romeo?

860
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:50,797
(all)
Romeo, Romeo.

861
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,298
Hey!

862
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:53,800
Shh!

863
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:56,302
I am the youngest
of that name

864
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:57,804
for fault of a worse.

865
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:00,306
If you be he, sir,

866
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:03,393
I desire some
conference with you.

867
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:05,687
(jeering and laughing)

868
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:10,692
She will indite him
to some supper.

869
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:12,193
A bawd, a bawd.

870
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,283
A bawd!

871
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:21,285
Aah!

872
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:24,580
(laughter)

873
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:26,791
You filthy varmint you!

874
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,710
Here she comes!

875
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,294
Mercutio, no!

876
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,296
Aah!

877
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,799
An old hare hoar

878
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,593
And an old hare hoar

879
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:41,389
Is very good meat,
in lent

880
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:44,809
But a hare
that is a hoar

881
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,813
Is too much
for a score

882
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:51,983
When it hoars
ere it be spent

883
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,109
(nurse) Aah!

884
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:54,402
(laughter and cheering)

885
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,487
Ooh!

886
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:59,907
(laughter)

887
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:03,911
Farewell, ancient lady.

888
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:05,705
Ooh!

889
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:08,708
(laughter and shouting)

890
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:12,712
Scurvy knave,
scurvy knave.

891
01:01:12,795 --> 01:01:15,006
I'm none of
his flirt-gills.

892
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:17,884
I'm none of
his skein mates.

893
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:20,720
Er, cur, lousy knave,

894
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:23,681
lousy, lousy knave.

895
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,099
I pray you, sir.

896
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:27,101
What saucy merchant
was this

897
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:28,895
that was so full
of his property?

898
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,481
A gentleman, nurse, that loves
to hear himself talk,

899
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:33,608
and will speak
more in a minute

900
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,610
than he will stand to
in a month.

901
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:36,903
I'll take him down,

902
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:38,905
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

903
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:40,198
and twenty such jacks;

904
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:43,701
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

905
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:45,787
Ha ha ha!

906
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:50,792
Ha ha ha!

907
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:55,296
And thou must
stand by too

908
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,715
and suffer every knave

909
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:00,510
to use me
at his pleasure.

910
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:04,180
Ooh...

911
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:07,183
Punk rampant!

912
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:10,186
Pray you, sir,
a word.

913
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:11,604
Ooh!

914
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,695
Beef wit.

915
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:22,699
(organ playing)

916
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:42,301
(choir singing)

917
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:05,199
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.

918
01:03:05,283 --> 01:03:07,702
What she did
bid me say,

919
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:09,704
I will keep to myself;,

920
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,206
but first
let me tell ye,

921
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:15,710
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--

922
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:17,211
Nurse.

923
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:18,713
Shh! As they say,

924
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:21,215
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,

925
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,717
for the gentlewoman
is young;

926
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,219
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,

927
01:03:25,303 --> 01:03:28,681
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

928
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,183
and very
weak dealing.

929
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:33,686
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,

930
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:35,813
I protest unto thee.

931
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:37,315
Bid her devise,

932
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:40,818
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,

933
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:44,781
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell

934
01:03:44,781 --> 01:03:48,993
be shrived and married.

935
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:51,287
Oh!

936
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:52,789
Oh!

937
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,792
Here's for thy pains.

938
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:58,795
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

939
01:03:58,795 --> 01:04:00,797
Go to,
I say you shall.

940
01:04:00,797 --> 01:04:01,881
No.

941
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,716
Well...

942
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,306
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

943
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:13,184
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.

944
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:14,686
Good-bye. Oh!

945
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:16,688
O there is
a noble man in town,

946
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:18,690
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

947
01:04:18,815 --> 01:04:22,694
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.

948
01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:25,196
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

949
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,698
A thousand times.

950
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:29,617
Ooh! Ooh!

951
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:55,810
(sighs)

952
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,814
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,

953
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:03,693
in half an hour
she promised to return...

954
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:06,195
perchance
she cannot meet him;

955
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:08,197
ahh, that's not so,

956
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:10,199
oh, she's lame,

957
01:05:10,283 --> 01:05:12,702
love's heralds
should be thoughts!

958
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:16,706
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

959
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,208
she would be
as swift in motion

960
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:20,710
as a ball.

961
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:24,714
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,

962
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:28,718
unwieldy, slow, heavy...

963
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:31,387
And pale as lead.

964
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:36,684
O God, she comes.

965
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:38,186
O honey nurse,
what news?

966
01:05:38,186 --> 01:05:41,189
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?

967
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:42,690
Oh!

968
01:05:42,815 --> 01:05:44,192
Though news be sad,

969
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:45,693
yet tell
them merrily.

970
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,195
(groaning)

971
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,696
Send the man away.

972
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,783
Peter, stay at the gate.

973
01:05:51,783 --> 01:05:54,285
Go on.

974
01:05:54,285 --> 01:05:56,287
Hast thou met
with him?

975
01:05:56,287 --> 01:05:57,789
Oh, I am aweary.

976
01:05:57,789 --> 01:05:59,290
Give me leave awhile.

977
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,292
Fie, how my bones ache!

978
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:03,711
Ooh!

979
01:06:03,795 --> 01:06:05,088
(groaning)

980
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:08,591
Sweet, sweet...

981
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:10,593
Sweet nurse.

982
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:13,096
Tell me, what says my love?

983
01:06:13,221 --> 01:06:15,098
Ha ha ha!

984
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:19,102
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

985
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:24,107
and courteous,
and kind,

986
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,110
and handsome,
and, I warrant him,

987
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:29,112
a virtuous--

988
01:06:29,195 --> 01:06:30,613
Where is your mother?

989
01:06:30,697 --> 01:06:32,115
Where is my mother?

990
01:06:32,198 --> 01:06:33,616
Why, she is within.

991
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,118
Where should she be?

992
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,619
How oddly thou repliest!

993
01:06:36,703 --> 01:06:39,080
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

994
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:40,081
where is your mother?"

995
01:06:40,206 --> 01:06:42,709
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?

996
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,210
Marry, come up I trow.

997
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:46,713
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

998
01:06:46,713 --> 01:06:48,214
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

999
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:49,716
Here's such a coil!

1000
01:06:49,716 --> 01:06:52,510
Come! What says Romeo?

1001
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,183
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

1002
01:06:59,183 --> 01:07:00,685
I have.

1003
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:02,186
(chuckling)

1004
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:05,690
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,

1005
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:10,194
there stays a husband
to make you a wife.

1006
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,780
Ha ha ha!

1007
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:17,201
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

1008
01:07:17,285 --> 01:07:20,288
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

1009
01:07:21,914 --> 01:07:23,708
Hie you to church!

1010
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,918
I'll to dinner.

1011
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:28,713
Honest nurse, farewell!

1012
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:31,090
Ha ha ha!

1013
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:41,684
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

1014
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:44,687
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

1015
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:47,690
Amen, amen.

1016
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,192
Come what sorrow can,

1017
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:51,694
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

1018
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:54,697
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

1019
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:56,699
These violent delights
have violent ends,

1020
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:58,201
and in
their triumph die,

1021
01:07:58,284 --> 01:07:59,702
like fire and powder,

1022
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:01,704
which as
they kiss consume.

1023
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,706
The sweetest honey
is loathsome

1024
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:05,208
in its own...

1025
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:06,709
Deliciousness.

1026
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:08,211
Deliciousness.

1027
01:08:08,211 --> 01:08:10,213
And in the taste
confounds the...

1028
01:08:10,213 --> 01:08:11,506
Appetite.

1029
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:12,799
Appetite.

1030
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:16,719
Therefore
love moderately...

1031
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,180
Long love doth so.

1032
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:22,100
Ah, here comes
the lady.

1033
01:08:22,183 --> 01:08:25,311
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.

1034
01:08:25,395 --> 01:08:27,188
Juliet!

1035
01:08:31,818 --> 01:08:34,195
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

1036
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,699
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

1037
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,200
Ah, Juliet,

1038
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:42,412
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

1039
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:45,206
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

1040
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:46,708
then sweeten
with thy breath

1041
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,209
this neighbor air.

1042
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:51,212
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

1043
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:54,716
But my true love is
grown to such excess,

1044
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:57,218
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

1045
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:58,720
Tsk tsk tsk!

1046
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:01,389
Come, come with me...

1047
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,308
We will make short work.

1048
01:09:03,391 --> 01:09:04,809
For, by your leaves,

1049
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:06,811
you shall not
stay alone

1050
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:10,189
till holy church
incorporate two in one.

1051
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,697
(organ plays)

1052
01:09:31,419 --> 01:09:36,382
(woman singing)

1053
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:59,090
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

1054
01:10:59,215 --> 01:11:01,718
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

1055
01:11:05,305 --> 01:11:07,807
I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire.

1056
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:09,684
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

1057
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:11,102
The day is hot.

1058
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:12,312
Blah, blah, blah.

1059
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,315
The Capulets abroad!

1060
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:16,607
Ha ha ha!

1061
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:17,817
(groans)

1062
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,986
If we meet we shall not
'scape a brawl.

1063
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:24,907
For now
these hot days,

1064
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:26,409
is the mad
blood stirring.

1065
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:30,913
Mercutio,
let's retire.

1066
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:34,500
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah!

1067
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:36,919
Thou art like one
of these fellows

1068
01:11:37,003 --> 01:11:39,380
that when he enters
the confines of a tavern

1069
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:41,382
claps me his sword
on the table,

1070
01:11:41,507 --> 01:11:43,885
and says, "God send me
no need of thee:"

1071
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,386
blah, blah,
blah, blah;

1072
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:47,388
and by the operation
of the second cup,

1073
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:48,890
draws him on
the drawer,

1074
01:11:49,015 --> 01:11:50,391
when indeed
there is no need.

1075
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:51,893
Am I like
such a fellow?

1076
01:11:52,018 --> 01:11:53,394
Nay and there were
two such

1077
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:54,896
we should have
none shortly,

1078
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,397
for the one would kill
the other.

1079
01:11:56,481 --> 01:11:58,399
Why thou hast
quarreled with a man

1080
01:11:58,483 --> 01:11:59,692
for coughing
in the street,

1081
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:02,695
because he hath wakened thy dog
that hath lain asleep

1082
01:12:02,695 --> 01:12:03,905
in the sun.

1083
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:05,406
Blah, blah, blah!

1084
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:09,410
And thou wilt tutor me
from quarreling! Hah!

1085
01:12:11,496 --> 01:12:13,915
Mercutio...

1086
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:16,501
By my head,
here come the Capulets.

1087
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:24,384
By my heel,
I care not.

1088
01:12:26,594 --> 01:12:28,888
(whistling)

1089
01:12:40,608 --> 01:12:42,402
(gurgling)

1090
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,198
Gentlemen, good den.

1091
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:48,908
Good den.

1092
01:12:48,992 --> 01:12:51,494
A word
with one of you.

1093
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:56,416
And but one word
with one of us.

1094
01:12:56,499 --> 01:12:57,917
Couple it
with something,

1095
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:00,920
make it a word
and a blow.

1096
01:13:01,004 --> 01:13:03,381
(laughter and jeers)

1097
01:13:05,008 --> 01:13:08,386
You shall find me
apt enough to that, sir,

1098
01:13:08,386 --> 01:13:09,721
and you will
give me occasion.

1099
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:13,099
Can you not take some occasion
without the giving?

1100
01:13:16,519 --> 01:13:19,188
Mercutio, thou
consortest with Romeo.

1101
01:13:19,314 --> 01:13:20,898
Consort? Ha ha ha!

1102
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:23,192
What dost thou
make us minstrels?

1103
01:13:23,318 --> 01:13:24,694
Ha ha ha!

1104
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:26,404
An you make
minstrels of us,

1105
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:28,906
you look to hear
nothing but discords.

1106
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,701
Here's my fiddlestick.

1107
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:33,995
Here's that shall
make you dance.

1108
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:35,288
Zounds! Consort!

1109
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:37,915
We talk here in
the public haunt of men.

1110
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:39,917
Either withdraw unto
some private place,

1111
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:41,919
or reason coldly
of your grievances,

1112
01:13:42,003 --> 01:13:43,379
or else depart;

1113
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:45,381
here all eyes gaze on us.

1114
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:47,884
Men's eyes
were made to look,

1115
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:49,385
and let them gaze.

1116
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,887
Mercutio!

1117
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:52,388
I will not budge for
no man's pleasure, I.

1118
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:55,892
Well, peace be
with you, sir,

1119
01:13:56,017 --> 01:13:57,894
here comes my man.

1120
01:13:57,894 --> 01:14:00,813
Mercutio!

1121
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:11,282
Tybalt.

1122
01:14:11,282 --> 01:14:13,785
Romeo, the love
I bear thee

1123
01:14:13,785 --> 01:14:15,995
can afford no better
term than this--

1124
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,497
thou art a villain.

1125
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,915
(whistles)

1126
01:14:18,998 --> 01:14:22,418
Tybalt, the reason that
I have to love thee

1127
01:14:22,502 --> 01:14:25,004
doth much excuse
the appertaining rage

1128
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:26,506
to such a greeting--

1129
01:14:26,506 --> 01:14:28,508
villain am I none.

1130
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:30,009
Therefore farewell,

1131
01:14:30,093 --> 01:14:32,011
I see thou knowest
not me.

1132
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:33,805
Ha ha ha!

1133
01:14:33,888 --> 01:14:36,391
Boy...

1134
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:40,395
This shall not excuse the injuries
thou hast done me,

1135
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,897
therefore turn
and draw.

1136
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:45,900
I do protest
I never injured thee,

1137
01:14:45,984 --> 01:14:48,695
but love thee better
than thou canst devise.

1138
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:51,406
Till thou shalt know
the reason of my love.

1139
01:14:51,489 --> 01:14:52,907
And so, good Capulet,

1140
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:58,287
which name I tender
as dearly as mine own,

1141
01:14:58,413 --> 01:15:00,915
be satisfied.

1142
01:15:00,999 --> 01:15:04,210
(crowd murmuring)

1143
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:06,087
Ha ha ha!

1144
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,590
No, no.

1145
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:18,891
Ugh!

1146
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:20,393
Ugh!

1147
01:15:20,393 --> 01:15:22,895
(laughter)

1148
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:27,400
Ha ha ha!

1149
01:15:29,402 --> 01:15:30,903
(Benvolio) No, Mercutio.

1150
01:15:30,987 --> 01:15:32,905
O calm, dishonorable,
vile submission!

1151
01:15:32,989 --> 01:15:34,407
No, Mercutio, no!

1152
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,908
Leave me...

1153
01:15:35,992 --> 01:15:37,910
Tybalt, you ratcatcher!

1154
01:15:37,994 --> 01:15:40,580
What wouldest thou
have with me?

1155
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,081
Good King of Cats,

1156
01:15:42,081 --> 01:15:44,917
nothing but one of
your nine lives,

1157
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:47,086
that I mean to
make bold withal...

1158
01:15:47,211 --> 01:15:50,089
And as you shall
use me hereafter...

1159
01:15:50,214 --> 01:15:52,592
Dry-beat the rest
of the eight.

1160
01:15:52,717 --> 01:15:54,886
Please, good Mercutio.

1161
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:58,389
Will you pluck your sword
out of his pilcher

1162
01:15:58,514 --> 01:15:59,891
by the ears?

1163
01:16:00,016 --> 01:16:01,392
Make haste,

1164
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:04,896
lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out.

1165
01:16:11,402 --> 01:16:12,987
I am for you, sir.

1166
01:16:13,112 --> 01:16:14,489
Ha ha ha!

1167
01:16:14,614 --> 01:16:16,908
Gentle Mercutio,
put thy rapier up.

1168
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:20,411
Come, come.

1169
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,415
(cheering)

1170
01:16:28,711 --> 01:16:30,380
Benvolio, beat down
their weapons!

1171
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,382
Gentlemen, for shame!
Forbear this outrage!

1172
01:16:32,382 --> 01:16:34,884
The Prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying

1173
01:16:34,884 --> 01:16:36,386
in Verona streets.

1174
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:38,388
Tybalt!

1175
01:16:38,513 --> 01:16:40,598
Mercutio!

1176
01:16:40,682 --> 01:16:42,809
Leave us!

1177
01:16:42,892 --> 01:16:44,811
Leave us away,
you coward!

1178
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:45,812
Go hang thyself.

1179
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:47,897
(laughter)

1180
01:16:50,483 --> 01:16:52,402
(cheering)

1181
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:58,408
Uh!

1182
01:16:58,491 --> 01:16:59,909
(men)
Ha ha ha!

1183
01:17:03,121 --> 01:17:04,706
(cheering stops)

1184
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:25,101
(whistling)

1185
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:28,396
Ha ha ha! Hey!

1186
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:29,897
Ha ha ha!

1187
01:17:29,981 --> 01:17:31,899
(crowd groaning)

1188
01:17:34,193 --> 01:17:36,404
(cheering)

1189
01:17:40,992 --> 01:17:42,201
Ha ha ha!

1190
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:43,911
Hey!

1191
01:17:47,498 --> 01:17:49,000
Aah!

1192
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,002
Cut his hair, Tybalt!

1193
01:17:51,002 --> 01:17:52,920
(cheering)

1194
01:17:54,505 --> 01:17:57,508
Ha ha ha!

1195
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:10,396
Hey!

1196
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,899
Keep your distance, Tybalt.

1197
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:18,196
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1198
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:19,906
(laughter)

1199
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:24,410
Keep away, coward!

1200
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:30,583
Make haste, Tybalt,
we cannot wait all day.

1201
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:36,089
Ah, mother's baby
has dropped his sword.

1202
01:18:36,089 --> 01:18:37,382
(laughter)

1203
01:18:37,507 --> 01:18:39,217
Hey!

1204
01:18:42,804 --> 01:18:43,680
Tybalt, no!

1205
01:18:43,805 --> 01:18:46,891
Abstain from
this crusade!

1206
01:18:47,016 --> 01:18:48,393
Tybalt, go!

1207
01:18:48,518 --> 01:18:50,395
Mercutio, come down!

1208
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:04,492
Begone, begone...

1209
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:07,412
Fly, Tybalt.
Fly away.

1210
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,917
(cheering)

1211
01:19:15,795 --> 01:19:17,296
I am hurt.

1212
01:19:28,016 --> 01:19:30,393
Uh!

1213
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:32,186
I am hurt.

1214
01:19:32,186 --> 01:19:33,980
(Benvolio) What! Art thou hurt?

1215
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:37,400
A scratch, a scratch,

1216
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,485
marry 'tis enough.

1217
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:42,488
Courage, man, the hurt
cannot be much.

1218
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:46,409
No, 'tis not so deep
as a well,

1219
01:19:46,492 --> 01:19:49,412
nor so wide as
a church door,

1220
01:19:49,495 --> 01:19:50,913
but 'tis enough;

1221
01:19:50,997 --> 01:19:52,915
you ask for me
tomorrow,

1222
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,918
and you shall find me
a grave man.

1223
01:19:56,002 --> 01:19:57,295
(cheering)

1224
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,881
Where is my page?

1225
01:20:00,006 --> 01:20:03,009
Go, villain,
and fetch me a surgeon.

1226
01:20:03,009 --> 01:20:04,510
Fetch me a surgeon!

1227
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,512
Ha ha ha!

1228
01:20:06,512 --> 01:20:08,097
Did he hurt you?

1229
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:23,905
Why the devil
came you between us?

1230
01:20:23,988 --> 01:20:26,407
I was hurt
under your arm.

1231
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:30,411
I thought all
for the best, I...

1232
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,419
(cheering)

1233
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,880
Help me into some house,
Benvolio,

1234
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:42,298
or I shall faint.

1235
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:48,888
(crowd) Whoa!

1236
01:20:49,013 --> 01:20:50,390
Whoa!

1237
01:20:50,515 --> 01:20:52,392
Whoa!

1238
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:53,893
Whoa!

1239
01:20:54,018 --> 01:20:55,395
Yay!

1240
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,400
A plague o'
both your houses!

1241
01:21:04,487 --> 01:21:09,409
They have made
worms' meat of me.

1242
01:21:11,494 --> 01:21:13,413
I have it,

1243
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:15,915
and soundly too...

1244
01:21:19,002 --> 01:21:20,586
Your houses!

1245
01:21:20,586 --> 01:21:22,213
He jests!

1246
01:21:24,007 --> 01:21:25,883
Mercutio!

1247
01:21:26,009 --> 01:21:27,885
(laughter)

1248
01:21:29,512 --> 01:21:33,391
Romeo, Romeo...

1249
01:21:33,516 --> 01:21:35,393
brave Mercutio's dead.

1250
01:21:35,518 --> 01:21:38,396
(crowd sneers)

1251
01:21:56,998 --> 01:21:59,417
This day's black fate,

1252
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,711
on more days doth depend.

1253
01:22:01,794 --> 01:22:06,299
This but begins the woe
others must end.

1254
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:09,385
He gone in triumph!

1255
01:22:09,385 --> 01:22:11,888
And Mercutio slain!

1256
01:22:12,013 --> 01:22:16,392
Away to heaven,
respective lenity,

1257
01:22:16,517 --> 01:22:19,312
and fire-eyed fury
be my conduct now!

1258
01:22:19,395 --> 01:22:21,397
(cheering)

1259
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:22,899
Tybalt!

1260
01:22:24,484 --> 01:22:26,986
Tybalt!

1261
01:22:26,986 --> 01:22:29,405
Romeo!

1262
01:22:33,493 --> 01:22:35,411
Tybalt!

1263
01:22:35,495 --> 01:22:36,913
Romeo!

1264
01:22:38,206 --> 01:22:41,709
This way!

1265
01:22:41,793 --> 01:22:43,920
Tybalt!

1266
01:22:44,003 --> 01:22:46,381
Romeo!

1267
01:22:46,506 --> 01:22:48,883
Tybalt!

1268
01:22:55,014 --> 01:22:57,892
Now, Tybalt...

1269
01:22:58,017 --> 01:22:59,894
Take the villain
back again,

1270
01:23:00,019 --> 01:23:02,397
that late thou gav'st me;

1271
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,898
for Mercutio's soul

1272
01:23:03,982 --> 01:23:06,901
is but a little way
above our heads,

1273
01:23:06,985 --> 01:23:09,904
staying for thine
to keep him company:

1274
01:23:09,904 --> 01:23:12,407
either thou, or l, or both,

1275
01:23:12,407 --> 01:23:13,908
must go with him!

1276
01:23:13,908 --> 01:23:15,910
Aah!

1277
01:23:19,914 --> 01:23:22,792
Let him go!
Let him go!

1278
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:31,384
Sword, Romeo.

1279
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:34,721
O thou wretched boy,

1280
01:23:34,721 --> 01:23:36,681
that didst
consort him here,

1281
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:38,182
shalt with him hence.

1282
01:23:38,391 --> 01:23:39,892
This shall
determine that.

1283
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:55,283
Hit the feet, Romeo!

1284
01:23:56,784 --> 01:23:59,495
Protect the eyes, Romeo!

1285
01:24:00,788 --> 01:24:03,291
(cheering and shouting)

1286
01:24:08,504 --> 01:24:10,506
Give me your sword.

1287
01:24:24,812 --> 01:24:26,189
Watch his feet!

1288
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:30,193
(crowd shouting)

1289
01:24:57,303 --> 01:24:59,305
Hyah!

1290
01:25:00,807 --> 01:25:04,310
(crowd shouting)

1291
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:15,196
(Romeo) Give me the sword!

1292
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:16,614
The sword!

1293
01:25:16,614 --> 01:25:18,616
The sword!

1294
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:20,201
(crowd shouting)

1295
01:25:50,982 --> 01:25:52,483
Romeo! Romeo!

1296
01:26:15,214 --> 01:26:16,215
(Tybalt) The sword!

1297
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:18,092
The sword!

1298
01:26:18,217 --> 01:26:19,719
Give it to me!

1299
01:26:19,802 --> 01:26:21,304
Your sword, Romeo!

1300
01:26:21,387 --> 01:26:22,889
The sword, Romeo!

1301
01:26:25,391 --> 01:26:27,101
(shouting stops)

1302
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:28,895
Aah!

1303
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:30,688
(Tybalt drops sword)

1304
01:26:35,693 --> 01:26:37,195
Tybalt!

1305
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,113
(crowd gasps)

1306
01:26:42,909 --> 01:26:45,119
Romeo, away, be gone.

1307
01:26:45,203 --> 01:26:46,621
The citizens are up.

1308
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:48,081
Stand not amazed,

1309
01:26:48,206 --> 01:26:50,208
the Prince will
doom thee death,

1310
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:51,501
if thou art taken.

1311
01:26:51,584 --> 01:26:53,086
Hence, go away!

1312
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:54,712
Romeo!

1313
01:26:59,092 --> 01:27:02,720
Oh, I am fortune's fool!

1314
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,807
Oh, Romeo!
Away, away!

1315
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:14,190
A curse on the Montagues!

1316
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:17,485
Oh, Tybalt!

1317
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,195
Tybalt! Tybalt!

1318
01:27:19,195 --> 01:27:21,197
The best friend I had,

1319
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,409
oh, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman,

1320
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:27,996
that ever I should live
to see thee dead!

1321
01:27:27,996 --> 01:27:29,205
Oh, God!

1322
01:27:29,288 --> 01:27:31,207
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

1323
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:34,210
It did, it did,
alas the day, it did!

1324
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:35,712
Oh, nurse,

1325
01:27:35,795 --> 01:27:40,216
oh, serpent heart,
hid with a flow'ring face!

1326
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:43,219
Was ever book containing
such vile matter

1327
01:27:43,303 --> 01:27:45,179
so fairly bound?

1328
01:27:45,305 --> 01:27:47,181
(crying)

1329
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,186
There's no faith,
no trust,

1330
01:27:52,312 --> 01:27:53,688
no honesty in men;

1331
01:27:53,813 --> 01:27:56,190
all perjured,
all forsworn,

1332
01:27:56,316 --> 01:27:58,693
all naught,
all dissemblers.

1333
01:27:58,818 --> 01:28:00,611
Shame come to Romeo.

1334
01:28:00,695 --> 01:28:04,198
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish.

1335
01:28:04,282 --> 01:28:06,701
He was not born
to shame.

1336
01:28:06,784 --> 01:28:09,495
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.

1337
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,081
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

1338
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:15,710
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

1339
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,211
(crying)

1340
01:28:17,211 --> 01:28:19,714
(crying)

1341
01:28:19,714 --> 01:28:22,216
Poor my lord,

1342
01:28:22,216 --> 01:28:24,719
what tongue shall
smooth thy name

1343
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,180
when I
thy three-hours wife

1344
01:28:27,305 --> 01:28:29,307
have mangled it?

1345
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:32,018
(crying)

1346
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:35,480
But wherefore villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

1347
01:28:35,688 --> 01:28:38,316
Capulet! To the prince!

1348
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:39,692
(crowd shouting)

1349
01:29:05,802 --> 01:29:08,096
Speak, Benvolio, speak!

1350
01:29:12,809 --> 01:29:14,686
Go on, speak.

1351
01:29:14,811 --> 01:29:16,688
Prince!
As thou art true,

1352
01:29:16,813 --> 01:29:18,982
for blood of ours
shed blood of Montague.

1353
01:29:19,107 --> 01:29:22,193
(crowd shouting)

1354
01:29:22,193 --> 01:29:25,196
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fray?

1355
01:29:25,196 --> 01:29:26,781
Tybalt, here slain.

1356
01:29:26,906 --> 01:29:28,700
(Lady Capulet) No!

1357
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,203
Romeo did
speak him fair,

1358
01:29:32,203 --> 01:29:35,206
bid him bethink how nice
the quarrel was,

1359
01:29:35,289 --> 01:29:37,083
and urged withal
your high displeasure.

1360
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:38,501
It's true, Prince.

1361
01:29:38,584 --> 01:29:40,211
The picture
makes him false.

1362
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:41,713
He speaks not true.

1363
01:29:41,796 --> 01:29:43,798
(crowd shouting)

1364
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:48,886
I beg for justice,

1365
01:29:49,012 --> 01:29:51,681
which thou,
Prince must give.

1366
01:29:51,806 --> 01:29:56,811
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.

1367
01:29:56,894 --> 01:29:59,397
(crowd shouting)

1368
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,399
Romeo slew him.

1369
01:30:12,201 --> 01:30:13,995
He slew Mercutio.

1370
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:24,505
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

1371
01:30:29,218 --> 01:30:31,679
Not Romeo, Prince...

1372
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,182
He was Mercutio's friend.

1373
01:30:34,182 --> 01:30:38,186
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.

1374
01:30:38,186 --> 01:30:40,313
The life of Tybalt!

1375
01:30:40,396 --> 01:30:41,689
And for that offense,

1376
01:30:41,814 --> 01:30:43,191
immediately we do
exile him hence.

1377
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:48,696
(Prince) Let Romeo
hence in haste,

1378
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,199
else, when he's found...

1379
01:30:51,282 --> 01:30:54,410
That hour is his last.

1380
01:31:07,215 --> 01:31:09,092
(crying)

1381
01:31:09,217 --> 01:31:11,594
Ah, banishment...

1382
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:13,096
Be merciful, say death!

1383
01:31:13,221 --> 01:31:14,597
(banging)

1384
01:31:14,681 --> 01:31:16,808
Do not say banishment.

1385
01:31:16,891 --> 01:31:18,101
Arise.

1386
01:31:18,184 --> 01:31:21,187
One knocks;
good Romeo, hide thyself.

1387
01:31:21,187 --> 01:31:22,480
Who's there?

1388
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,690
(bang bang)

1389
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:26,192
Who knocks so hard?

1390
01:31:26,192 --> 01:31:28,695
Whence come you?

1391
01:31:28,695 --> 01:31:30,196
What's your will?

1392
01:31:30,196 --> 01:31:32,198
(nurse) Let me come in,

1393
01:31:32,198 --> 01:31:34,701
and you shall know
my errand.

1394
01:31:34,701 --> 01:31:36,703
I come from
Lady Juliet.

1395
01:31:36,703 --> 01:31:39,205
(Romeo crying)

1396
01:31:39,205 --> 01:31:41,207
Welcome then.

1397
01:31:41,207 --> 01:31:43,710
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,

1398
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:45,712
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?

1399
01:31:45,712 --> 01:31:48,381
There, on the ground.

1400
01:31:48,506 --> 01:31:50,008
With his own tears
made drunk.

1401
01:31:50,008 --> 01:31:53,720
(Romeo) There is no world
without Verona walls.

1402
01:31:53,803 --> 01:31:56,180
Even so lies she,

1403
01:31:56,306 --> 01:31:57,682
blubbering and weeping,

1404
01:31:57,807 --> 01:31:59,183
weeping and blubbering.

1405
01:31:59,309 --> 01:32:00,685
(crying)

1406
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:02,186
Stand up!

1407
01:32:02,312 --> 01:32:05,690
Stand and you
be a man.

1408
01:32:05,815 --> 01:32:08,109
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake,

1409
01:32:08,192 --> 01:32:09,610
rise and stand.

1410
01:32:09,694 --> 01:32:13,114
Why should you fall
into so deep an 'ole?

1411
01:32:13,197 --> 01:32:14,615
Nurse.

1412
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:17,618
Ah, sir, death's
the end of all.

1413
01:32:17,702 --> 01:32:19,120
Speakst thou of Juliet?

1414
01:32:19,203 --> 01:32:20,580
How is it with her?

1415
01:32:20,705 --> 01:32:23,207
Does she not think
me an old murderer?

1416
01:32:23,207 --> 01:32:25,710
Where is she?
How doth she?

1417
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:27,211
What says
my concealed lady

1418
01:32:27,211 --> 01:32:28,713
to our canceled love?

1419
01:32:28,713 --> 01:32:31,716
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,

1420
01:32:31,716 --> 01:32:33,885
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.

1421
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:36,888
As if that name
did murder her.

1422
01:32:37,013 --> 01:32:39,682
O tell me, friar,
tell me,

1423
01:32:39,682 --> 01:32:42,685
in what vile part
of this anatomy

1424
01:32:42,685 --> 01:32:44,187
doth my name lodge?

1425
01:32:44,187 --> 01:32:48,399
Tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion!

1426
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:49,692
(nurse screaming)

1427
01:32:49,692 --> 01:32:51,194
Hold thy
desperate hand.

1428
01:32:51,194 --> 01:32:52,695
By heavens!
Leave it!

1429
01:32:55,782 --> 01:32:58,201
Thou hast amazed me.

1430
01:32:58,284 --> 01:33:00,203
Thou a man?

1431
01:33:00,286 --> 01:33:02,705
Thy form
cries out thou art.

1432
01:33:02,789 --> 01:33:04,707
Thy tears
are womanish,

1433
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:08,586
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast.

1434
01:33:08,711 --> 01:33:10,588
Hast thou slain Tybalt?

1435
01:33:10,713 --> 01:33:13,091
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,

1436
01:33:13,216 --> 01:33:14,592
that in thy life lives,

1437
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:16,094
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?

1438
01:33:16,219 --> 01:33:18,596
Rouse thee, man...

1439
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:22,100
Thy Juliet is alive.

1440
01:33:22,183 --> 01:33:24,602
There art thou happy.

1441
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:26,104
Tybalt would kill thee,

1442
01:33:26,187 --> 01:33:27,605
but thou slewest Tybalt;

1443
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:29,107
there art thou happy.

1444
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:32,193
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend,

1445
01:33:32,193 --> 01:33:34,112
and turns it to exile;

1446
01:33:34,112 --> 01:33:35,613
there art thou happy.

1447
01:33:35,613 --> 01:33:39,200
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back...

1448
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:44,288
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

1449
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:49,210
But look thou stay
not till the watch be set,

1450
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:51,713
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,

1451
01:33:51,713 --> 01:33:54,716
where thou shalt live
till we find a time

1452
01:33:54,716 --> 01:33:57,218
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

1453
01:33:57,218 --> 01:34:00,179
beg pardon of the Prince,
and call thee home,

1454
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:03,182
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy

1455
01:34:03,308 --> 01:34:05,310
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.

1456
01:34:08,688 --> 01:34:10,106
Go before, nurse...

1457
01:34:10,189 --> 01:34:11,607
Commend me to thy lady,

1458
01:34:11,691 --> 01:34:14,610
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,

1459
01:34:14,694 --> 01:34:17,613
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto

1460
01:34:17,697 --> 01:34:19,615
Romeo's coming.

1461
01:35:13,002 --> 01:35:15,004
(birds chirping)

1462
01:36:25,283 --> 01:36:28,119
Wilt thou be gone?

1463
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:35,585
It is not yet
near day.

1464
01:36:35,585 --> 01:36:38,588
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1465
01:36:38,588 --> 01:36:43,593
that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.

1466
01:36:43,593 --> 01:36:46,679
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.

1467
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:49,098
Oh, believe me, love,

1468
01:36:49,098 --> 01:36:52,602
it was the nightingale.

1469
01:36:52,685 --> 01:36:55,605
It was the lark...

1470
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:58,608
The herald of the morn,

1471
01:36:58,691 --> 01:37:00,610
no nightingale.

1472
01:37:02,195 --> 01:37:07,116
Night's candles
are burnt out...

1473
01:37:13,206 --> 01:37:20,588
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.

1474
01:37:23,216 --> 01:37:26,094
I must be gone and live,

1475
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:28,388
or stay and die.

1476
01:37:30,181 --> 01:37:34,102
Yond light is not
daylight...

1477
01:37:34,185 --> 01:37:37,105
I know it, I.

1478
01:37:39,691 --> 01:37:41,985
Therefore stay yet,

1479
01:37:41,985 --> 01:37:45,113
thou needst not
to be gone.

1480
01:37:45,196 --> 01:37:46,614
Oh, let me be taken,

1481
01:37:46,698 --> 01:37:49,117
let me be put to death.

1482
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,120
I am content so thou
wilt have it so.

1483
01:37:52,203 --> 01:37:55,081
I'll say yon gray
is not the morning's eye,

1484
01:37:55,206 --> 01:37:57,083
nor that is not
the lark

1485
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:59,711
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heavens

1486
01:37:59,711 --> 01:38:01,004
so high above
our heads.

1487
01:38:01,087 --> 01:38:06,217
I have more care
to stay than will to go.

1488
01:38:06,217 --> 01:38:09,595
Come death, and welcome,
Juliet wills it so.

1489
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:12,098
(lark chirping)

1490
01:38:12,181 --> 01:38:14,600
It is...

1491
01:38:14,684 --> 01:38:17,520
It is, hie hence,
be gone away.

1492
01:38:17,603 --> 01:38:20,481
Romeo, it is.

1493
01:38:23,693 --> 01:38:27,613
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,

1494
01:38:27,697 --> 01:38:32,118
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.

1495
01:38:32,201 --> 01:38:35,079
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;

1496
01:38:35,204 --> 01:38:39,083
oh, this doth not so,
for she divideth us.

1497
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:40,585
So now be gone,

1498
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,795
more light and light
it grows.

1499
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,297
More light and light,

1500
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:49,093
more dark and dark
our woes.

1501
01:38:49,218 --> 01:38:51,220
(banging on door)

1502
01:38:51,304 --> 01:38:52,597
(nurse) Madam!

1503
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,600
Your lady mother
comes to your chamber.

1504
01:38:57,685 --> 01:38:59,103
Nurse.

1505
01:38:59,187 --> 01:39:02,106
Your lady mother is
coming to your chamber.

1506
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,108
The day is broke,
look about.

1507
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:08,613
Oh, art thou gone so,

1508
01:39:08,696 --> 01:39:10,114
my husband, friend?

1509
01:39:10,198 --> 01:39:13,618
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1510
01:39:13,701 --> 01:39:16,120
for in a minute
there are many days,

1511
01:39:16,204 --> 01:39:19,582
o by this count
I shall be much in years,

1512
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:21,584
ere I again behold my Romeo.

1513
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:23,586
I will omit
no opportunity

1514
01:39:23,711 --> 01:39:26,089
that may convey
my greetings, love, to thee.

1515
01:39:28,716 --> 01:39:31,594
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1516
01:39:33,221 --> 01:39:36,099
I doubt it not,

1517
01:39:36,182 --> 01:39:38,601
and all these woes
shall serve

1518
01:39:38,685 --> 01:39:42,105
for sweet discourses
in our time to come.

1519
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:48,111
Farewell, farewell,

1520
01:39:48,194 --> 01:39:50,613
one kiss
and I'll descend.

1521
01:39:55,702 --> 01:39:58,579
(rooster crows)

1522
01:40:14,721 --> 01:40:16,097
Adieu.

1523
01:40:21,394 --> 01:40:24,397
Adieu!

1524
01:40:26,691 --> 01:40:29,110
(crying)

1525
01:40:29,193 --> 01:40:31,988
Oh, God!

1526
01:40:51,007 --> 01:40:53,092
(Juliet crying)

1527
01:40:53,217 --> 01:40:56,095
We will have vengeance
for it,

1528
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,597
fear thou not...

1529
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:00,099
(Juliet) No!

1530
01:41:00,183 --> 01:41:01,601
Then weep no more.

1531
01:41:01,684 --> 01:41:03,102
(Juliet sobbing)

1532
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:10,109
I'll send to one
in Mantua,

1533
01:41:10,109 --> 01:41:13,112
where that same
banished runagate doth live

1534
01:41:13,112 --> 01:41:17,617
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,

1535
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,620
that he shall soon
keep Tybalt company.

1536
01:41:20,703 --> 01:41:23,081
(Juliet) No!

1537
01:41:23,206 --> 01:41:27,085
But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.

1538
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:30,588
Well, then thou hast
a careful father,

1539
01:41:30,713 --> 01:41:33,591
one who to put thee
from thy heaviness

1540
01:41:33,716 --> 01:41:36,094
hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.

1541
01:41:38,221 --> 01:41:41,599
And joy comes well
in such a needy time.

1542
01:41:41,683 --> 01:41:44,602
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,

1543
01:41:44,686 --> 01:41:47,105
the gallant, young
and noble prince,

1544
01:41:47,188 --> 01:41:50,108
the county Paris,
at St. Peter's church,

1545
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:53,111
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.

1546
01:41:54,696 --> 01:41:58,616
Now by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,

1547
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:03,121
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!

1548
01:42:03,204 --> 01:42:05,498
No! No!

1549
01:42:09,502 --> 01:42:11,212
So, it is concluded.

1550
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:18,219
Son, Paris.

1551
01:42:21,306 --> 01:42:25,393
How now, wife, have you
delivered to her our decree?

1552
01:42:25,518 --> 01:42:28,104
Ay, sir,
but she will none,

1553
01:42:28,187 --> 01:42:30,106
she gives you thanks.

1554
01:42:30,189 --> 01:42:31,399
(crying)

1555
01:42:31,482 --> 01:42:34,902
I would the fool were
married to her grave.

1556
01:42:36,696 --> 01:42:41,117
Soft...
take me with you.

1557
01:42:42,702 --> 01:42:45,079
Take me with you, wife.

1558
01:42:45,204 --> 01:42:47,582
How? Will she none?

1559
01:42:47,707 --> 01:42:50,084
Doth she not
give us thanks?

1560
01:42:50,209 --> 01:42:52,587
Is she not proud?

1561
01:42:52,712 --> 01:42:56,090
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

1562
01:42:56,215 --> 01:43:00,720
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

1563
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,181
Wretched fool!
Let me see her!

1564
01:43:03,306 --> 01:43:04,682
Ungrateful baggage!

1565
01:43:04,682 --> 01:43:08,102
Say what thou wilt,
thou shalt not house with me!

1566
01:43:08,186 --> 01:43:09,812
Fie! What, are you mad?

1567
01:43:09,896 --> 01:43:11,606
Hang thee,
young baggage!

1568
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:12,815
Disobedient wretch!

1569
01:43:12,899 --> 01:43:16,110
I tell thee what,
get thee to church on Thursday,

1570
01:43:16,194 --> 01:43:19,113
or never after
look me in the face.

1571
01:43:19,197 --> 01:43:21,616
Oh, father, good father,
I beseech you.

1572
01:43:21,699 --> 01:43:24,118
Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.

1573
01:43:24,202 --> 01:43:25,620
My fingers itch.

1574
01:43:25,703 --> 01:43:28,581
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.

1575
01:43:28,706 --> 01:43:30,083
And why,
my lady wisdom?

1576
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:31,584
Hold your tongue!

1577
01:43:31,709 --> 01:43:34,087
Good prudence, smatter
with your gossips, go!

1578
01:43:34,212 --> 01:43:35,588
I speak no treason.

1579
01:43:35,713 --> 01:43:37,090
May not one speak?

1580
01:43:37,215 --> 01:43:38,591
Speak!
You mumbling fool!

1581
01:43:38,716 --> 01:43:40,593
Utter your gravity
o'er a gossip's bowl,

1582
01:43:40,718 --> 01:43:42,095
for here we need it not.

1583
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:43,596
You are too hot.

1584
01:43:43,596 --> 01:43:45,098
(crying)

1585
01:43:45,181 --> 01:43:48,017
God's bread,
it makes me mad.

1586
01:43:51,187 --> 01:43:52,313
Thursday's near.

1587
01:43:52,397 --> 01:43:54,607
Lay hand on heart, advise.

1588
01:43:54,691 --> 01:43:57,694
An you be mine,
I give you to my friend;

1589
01:43:57,819 --> 01:43:59,112
an you be not,

1590
01:43:59,195 --> 01:44:01,990
hang, beg, starve,
die in the streets.

1591
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:03,116
No!

1592
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,702
For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

1593
01:44:05,785 --> 01:44:08,788
for what is mine
shall never do thee good.

1594
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:10,081
Father!

1595
01:44:10,206 --> 01:44:15,086
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.

1596
01:44:15,211 --> 01:44:16,713
(sobbing)

1597
01:44:21,801 --> 01:44:24,804
Oh, no! No!

1598
01:44:24,804 --> 01:44:27,598
Oh sweet, my mother,
cast me not away.

1599
01:44:27,682 --> 01:44:30,101
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week, oh!

1600
01:44:30,184 --> 01:44:33,187
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.

1601
01:44:35,398 --> 01:44:38,609
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1602
01:44:42,196 --> 01:44:45,491
Oh, God!

1603
01:44:45,616 --> 01:44:46,617
Oh, nurse?

1604
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:48,619
How shall this
be prevented?

1605
01:44:48,703 --> 01:44:50,580
What sayest thou?

1606
01:44:50,705 --> 01:44:53,583
Hast thou not
a word of joy?

1607
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:56,002
Some comfort, nurse.

1608
01:44:56,002 --> 01:44:58,588
Faith, here it is.

1609
01:44:58,713 --> 01:45:01,090
Romeo is banished...

1610
01:45:03,217 --> 01:45:05,595
And all the world
to nothing,

1611
01:45:05,595 --> 01:45:08,598
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;

1612
01:45:08,598 --> 01:45:12,602
or if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.

1613
01:45:12,685 --> 01:45:17,106
Then since the case so stands
as now it doth,

1614
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:21,986
I think it best
you marry with the county.

1615
01:45:32,705 --> 01:45:34,082
True.

1616
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:38,586
O he's a lovely
gentleman.

1617
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:45,218
Romeo's
a dishclout to him.

1618
01:45:46,594 --> 01:45:49,514
An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,

1619
01:45:49,597 --> 01:45:53,017
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.

1620
01:45:53,101 --> 01:45:54,519
Beshrew my heart,

1621
01:45:54,602 --> 01:45:57,981
I think you happy
in this second match.

1622
01:45:58,106 --> 01:46:00,817
It excels your first.

1623
01:46:02,402 --> 01:46:05,905
For if it did not,
your first is dead,

1624
01:46:05,989 --> 01:46:08,992
or 'twere as good he were
as living here,

1625
01:46:08,992 --> 01:46:11,995
and you no use of him.

1626
01:46:11,995 --> 01:46:14,789
Speakest thou
from thy heart?

1627
01:46:19,002 --> 01:46:21,087
And from my soul, too...

1628
01:46:23,506 --> 01:46:25,508
Or else
beshrew them both.

1629
01:46:25,508 --> 01:46:27,010
Amen.

1630
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:28,011
(drawing curtain)

1631
01:46:28,011 --> 01:46:29,512
What?

1632
01:46:29,512 --> 01:46:34,309
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvelous much.

1633
01:46:37,603 --> 01:46:40,982
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,

1634
01:46:41,107 --> 01:46:42,483
having displeased my father,

1635
01:46:42,608 --> 01:46:44,485
to Laurence's cell,

1636
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:47,488
to make confession
and to be absolved.

1637
01:46:48,906 --> 01:46:52,994
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.

1638
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,495
Go!

1639
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,403
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.

1640
01:47:27,403 --> 01:47:30,406
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.

1641
01:47:30,406 --> 01:47:32,909
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,

1642
01:47:32,909 --> 01:47:35,411
and therefore have I
little talked of love,

1643
01:47:35,495 --> 01:47:38,414
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.

1644
01:47:38,498 --> 01:47:39,707
(footsteps)

1645
01:47:44,003 --> 01:47:45,380
Oh!

1646
01:47:49,509 --> 01:47:52,512
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.

1647
01:47:55,014 --> 01:47:58,810
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.

1648
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:03,898
Come you to make
confession to this father?

1649
01:48:06,401 --> 01:48:08,820
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,

1650
01:48:08,903 --> 01:48:11,698
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?

1651
01:48:11,781 --> 01:48:13,992
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.

1652
01:48:14,117 --> 01:48:16,619
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.

1653
01:48:16,703 --> 01:48:19,414
God shield I should
disturb devotion.

1654
01:48:19,414 --> 01:48:22,792
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.

1655
01:48:24,419 --> 01:48:26,879
Till then, adieu...

1656
01:48:28,881 --> 01:48:32,385
and keep this holy kiss.

1657
01:48:38,099 --> 01:48:39,892
(sobbing)

1658
01:48:39,892 --> 01:48:43,688
Oh, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,

1659
01:48:43,813 --> 01:48:46,399
come weep with me,
past hope,

1660
01:48:46,482 --> 01:48:50,111
past care, past help.

1661
01:48:59,996 --> 01:49:02,915
Oh, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.

1662
01:49:02,999 --> 01:49:05,793
Tell me not, Friar,
that thou heard'st of this,

1663
01:49:05,918 --> 01:49:08,796
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.

1664
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,300
If in thy wisdom
thou cans't give no help...

1665
01:49:12,383 --> 01:49:14,302
(sobbing)

1666
01:49:24,896 --> 01:49:26,481
Hold, daughter.

1667
01:49:30,401 --> 01:49:33,404
I do spy a kind of hope,

1668
01:49:33,404 --> 01:49:35,907
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1669
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:41,913
If rather than to marry
county Paris,

1670
01:49:41,996 --> 01:49:43,915
thou hast
the strength of will to--

1671
01:49:43,915 --> 01:49:45,917
O bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,

1672
01:49:45,917 --> 01:49:47,418
from off the battlements
of any tower,

1673
01:49:47,418 --> 01:49:49,212
or bid me go
into a new-made grave

1674
01:49:49,295 --> 01:49:51,881
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.

1675
01:49:52,006 --> 01:49:53,007
Hold then.

1676
01:50:06,187 --> 01:50:07,313
Go home.

1677
01:50:08,898 --> 01:50:10,316
Be merry.

1678
01:50:13,111 --> 01:50:15,279
Give consent
to marry Paris.

1679
01:50:15,405 --> 01:50:16,781
Oh, no.

1680
01:50:16,781 --> 01:50:19,701
Wednesday is tomorrow.

1681
01:50:22,412 --> 01:50:25,415
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,

1682
01:50:25,415 --> 01:50:29,002
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.

1683
01:50:37,385 --> 01:50:41,014
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed...

1684
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:49,480
And this distilling liquor
drink thou off...

1685
01:50:52,191 --> 01:50:55,403
When presently through
all thy veins shall run

1686
01:50:55,486 --> 01:50:58,281
a cold and drowsy humor;,

1687
01:50:58,406 --> 01:51:02,785
for no pulse shall keep
his native progress,

1688
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:04,287
but surcease;

1689
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:09,917
no warmth, no breath
shall testify thou livest...

1690
01:51:13,796 --> 01:51:16,799
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

1691
01:51:16,883 --> 01:51:22,805
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours...

1692
01:51:28,811 --> 01:51:33,399
And then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1693
01:51:36,402 --> 01:51:41,407
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake

1694
01:51:41,491 --> 01:51:44,786
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,

1695
01:51:44,911 --> 01:51:46,788
and hither shall he come,

1696
01:51:46,913 --> 01:51:49,290
and he and I
will watch thy waking,

1697
01:51:49,415 --> 01:51:54,003
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.

1698
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,382
Give me, give me!

1699
01:51:57,507 --> 01:51:59,717
Tell me not of fear.

1700
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:01,594
Hold, then.

1701
01:52:10,311 --> 01:52:11,813
Get thee gone.

1702
01:52:11,813 --> 01:52:14,315
Be strong and prosperous
in this resolve.

1703
01:52:50,893 --> 01:52:52,812
How now, my headstrong.

1704
01:52:52,895 --> 01:52:54,814
Where have you
been gadding?

1705
01:52:54,897 --> 01:52:56,816
Where I have learnt me

1706
01:52:56,899 --> 01:52:59,319
to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition.

1707
01:53:01,404 --> 01:53:03,281
Pardon me,
henceforward l,

1708
01:53:03,406 --> 01:53:06,701
I am ever ruled by you.

1709
01:53:06,784 --> 01:53:09,704
Why, I am glad on't!

1710
01:53:09,787 --> 01:53:12,290
This is well.
Stand up.

1711
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:14,584
This is
as it should be.

1712
01:53:51,913 --> 01:53:53,998
Love give me strength.

1713
01:54:19,816 --> 01:54:22,819
Give this letter
into the hand of Romeo,

1714
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:23,903
in Mantua.

1715
01:54:53,391 --> 01:54:55,810
(woman screaming)

1716
01:54:58,896 --> 01:55:00,815
Aah!

1717
01:55:00,898 --> 01:55:02,317
My lord! My lord!

1718
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:06,112
She's dead,
Juliet is dead!

1719
01:55:06,195 --> 01:55:08,990
My Lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!

1720
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:10,700
Juliet!

1721
01:55:10,783 --> 01:55:12,493
Juliet!

1722
01:55:12,619 --> 01:55:14,495
Juliet!

1723
01:55:14,621 --> 01:55:16,581
My baby,
where is she?

1724
01:55:19,292 --> 01:55:23,212
(Capulet) O lamentable day.

1725
01:55:23,296 --> 01:55:27,300
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

1726
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:32,096
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

1727
01:55:39,812 --> 01:55:41,814
(singing in Latin)

1728
01:56:47,297 --> 01:56:49,799
(crying)

1729
01:57:25,793 --> 01:57:27,295
(singing stops)

1730
01:57:46,814 --> 01:57:48,483
Master.

1731
01:57:48,608 --> 01:57:50,109
Balthasar!

1732
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:54,781
How fares my Juliet?

1733
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:57,992
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.

1734
01:57:58,117 --> 01:58:00,912
How fares my lady?

1735
01:58:07,585 --> 01:58:09,212
(sobbing)

1736
01:58:13,299 --> 01:58:15,218
She's dead, my lord.

1737
01:58:15,301 --> 01:58:17,220
She's dead.

1738
01:58:17,303 --> 01:58:20,181
Her body sleeps
in capel's monument.

1739
01:58:20,306 --> 01:58:24,185
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.

1740
01:58:34,821 --> 01:58:38,700
Then, I defy you, stars!

1741
02:00:02,784 --> 02:00:03,785
Live...

1742
02:00:05,411 --> 02:00:08,581
and be prosperous.

1743
02:00:08,706 --> 02:00:11,084
Farewell, good fellow.

1744
02:01:19,819 --> 02:01:21,112
Juliet.

1745
02:02:11,287 --> 02:02:12,789
O my love...

1746
02:02:17,794 --> 02:02:19,212
My wife.

1747
02:02:21,798 --> 02:02:25,718
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,

1748
02:02:25,802 --> 02:02:28,888
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

1749
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:35,687
Thou art not conquered...

1750
02:02:38,815 --> 02:02:43,695
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips

1751
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:46,197
and in thy cheeks.

1752
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:51,202
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

1753
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:58,793
Tybalt.

1754
02:03:04,299 --> 02:03:08,094
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?

1755
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:22,400
What more favor
can I do to thee,

1756
02:03:22,483 --> 02:03:26,904
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain

1757
02:03:26,988 --> 02:03:32,702
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?

1758
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:41,419
Forgive me, cousin.

1759
02:03:52,013 --> 02:03:54,599
Ah, dear Juliet.

1760
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:02,106
Why art thou yet so fair?

1761
02:04:04,484 --> 02:04:07,403
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

1762
02:04:07,403 --> 02:04:09,906
and that the lean
abhorred monster

1763
02:04:09,906 --> 02:04:13,201
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1764
02:04:13,201 --> 02:04:19,916
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.

1765
02:04:24,003 --> 02:04:29,884
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

1766
02:04:32,011 --> 02:04:37,392
Here, here will I remain,

1767
02:04:37,517 --> 02:04:42,897
with worms that are
thy chambermaids.

1768
02:04:42,981 --> 02:04:44,691
(sobbing)

1769
02:05:00,498 --> 02:05:04,294
Eyes, look your last.

1770
02:05:09,882 --> 02:05:13,886
Arms, take your last embrace.

1771
02:05:16,389 --> 02:05:21,394
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,

1772
02:05:21,394 --> 02:05:23,396
seal with a righteous kiss

1773
02:05:23,396 --> 02:05:26,190
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

1774
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:06,981
Here's to my love.

1775
02:06:34,384 --> 02:06:37,512
Thus with a kiss...

1776
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:40,890
I die.

1777
02:06:54,487 --> 02:06:55,905
Who's there?

1778
02:06:55,989 --> 02:06:59,409
A friend, and one
that knows thee well.

1779
02:06:59,492 --> 02:07:02,412
Balthasar. How long
hast thou been here?

1780
02:07:02,495 --> 02:07:03,913
Full half an hour.

1781
02:07:03,997 --> 02:07:06,291
Go with me to the vault.

1782
02:07:06,416 --> 02:07:07,792
I dare not, sir.

1783
02:07:07,917 --> 02:07:10,795
My master knows not
that I am gone hence.

1784
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:13,506
Stay then,
I'll go alone.

1785
02:07:15,383 --> 02:07:17,385
Fear comes upon me.

1786
02:07:17,385 --> 02:07:20,680
O much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.

1787
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:00,887
Romeo!

1788
02:08:11,898 --> 02:08:13,816
Oh, what an unkind hour

1789
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:17,487
is guilty of this
lamentable chance?

1790
02:09:00,989 --> 02:09:02,407
(Juliet) Ohh!

1791
02:09:09,914 --> 02:09:15,211
O comfortable Friar,
where is my lord?

1792
02:09:16,879 --> 02:09:19,799
I do remember well
where I should be,

1793
02:09:19,882 --> 02:09:21,801
and there I am.

1794
02:09:21,884 --> 02:09:23,803
Where is my Romeo?

1795
02:09:23,886 --> 02:09:26,389
(trumpet plays in distance)

1796
02:09:26,389 --> 02:09:28,391
I hear some noise.

1797
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,893
Oh, where is my Romeo?

1798
02:09:30,893 --> 02:09:34,897
Oh, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,

1799
02:09:34,897 --> 02:09:36,399
and unnatural sleep.

1800
02:09:38,401 --> 02:09:41,404
A greater power
than we can contradict

1801
02:09:41,404 --> 02:09:42,905
hath thwarted
our intents.

1802
02:09:42,905 --> 02:09:45,408
Come along.
The watch is coming.

1803
02:09:45,408 --> 02:09:47,493
Where is my Romeo?

1804
02:09:47,619 --> 02:09:49,412
(Juliet gasps)

1805
02:09:53,916 --> 02:09:56,210
Come. Go, good Juliet.

1806
02:09:57,503 --> 02:09:58,880
No.

1807
02:09:59,005 --> 02:10:00,882
I dare no longer stay.

1808
02:10:01,007 --> 02:10:02,383
No!

1809
02:10:02,508 --> 02:10:05,303
I dare no longer stay.

1810
02:10:05,303 --> 02:10:06,804
Juliet!

1811
02:10:06,888 --> 02:10:08,806
(trumpet)

1812
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:11,309
I dare no longer stay.

1813
02:10:11,392 --> 02:10:13,811
I dare
no longer stay!

1814
02:10:54,394 --> 02:10:56,521
What's here?

1815
02:11:01,901 --> 02:11:05,613
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

1816
02:11:09,409 --> 02:11:11,286
O churl!

1817
02:11:11,411 --> 02:11:14,289
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

1818
02:11:14,414 --> 02:11:16,291
to help me after!

1819
02:11:16,416 --> 02:11:18,293
I will kiss thy lips;

1820
02:11:18,418 --> 02:11:21,296
haply some poison
yet doth hang on them

1821
02:11:21,421 --> 02:11:24,299
to make me die
with a restorative.

1822
02:11:29,887 --> 02:11:32,307
Thy lips are warm!

1823
02:11:43,401 --> 02:11:46,195
Oh, no, no!

1824
02:11:56,914 --> 02:11:58,916
(man) Lead, boy, which way?

1825
02:11:58,916 --> 02:12:00,793
Search about
the churchyard.

1826
02:12:00,793 --> 02:12:02,420
Go, some of you...

1827
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:03,880
Yea, noise?

1828
02:12:08,384 --> 02:12:09,510
No!

1829
02:12:14,015 --> 02:12:19,395
Then I'll be brief,
o happy dagger!

1830
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:23,900
This is thy sheath;

1831
02:12:23,983 --> 02:12:27,403
there rest and let me die.

1832
02:12:27,487 --> 02:12:29,405
(moaning)

1833
02:12:47,382 --> 02:12:49,384
(bells tolling)

1834
02:14:17,805 --> 02:14:20,183
Where be these enemies?

1835
02:14:22,810 --> 02:14:24,103
Capulet!

1836
02:14:27,815 --> 02:14:29,192
Montague!

1837
02:14:37,283 --> 02:14:41,287
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

1838
02:14:42,789 --> 02:14:47,919
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love;

1839
02:14:48,002 --> 02:14:57,720
and l, for winking
at your discords too,

1840
02:14:57,804 --> 02:15:02,392
have lost
a brace of kinsmen.

1841
02:15:04,811 --> 02:15:07,480
All are punished.

1842
02:15:12,819 --> 02:15:15,196
All are punished!

1843
02:15:46,311 --> 02:15:51,316
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

1844
02:15:51,316 --> 02:15:56,779
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head,

1845
02:15:56,779 --> 02:16:00,283
for never was a story
of more woe

1846
02:16:00,283 --> 02:16:05,496
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
