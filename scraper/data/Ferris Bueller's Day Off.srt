1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,260
<i>lt is a beautiful day in Chicago today.</i>

2
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,930
<i>Temperatures expected
to reach the upper 70s.</i>

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,390
<i>Right now, 75 at the lakefront,</i>

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,060
<i>74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.</i>

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>And now, up in the sky,</i>

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,990
<i>-Don NeIson with SkyView traffic.
-Ferris?</i>

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,280
<i>-Thanks. We've got scores of accidents.
-Ferris?</i>

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,450
Tom!

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,330
-What's the matter?
-lt's Ferris.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,290
-What? What's wrong?
-What's wrong? For Christ's sake

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,160
look at him, honey.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,790
Ferris?

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,880
He doesn't have a fever, but he says his
stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,840
What's the matter, Ferris?

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,970
Papa?

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,760
Honey, feel his hands.
They're cold and clammy.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,600
l'm fine.

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,940
-l can get up.
-No.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,610
-l have a test today.
-No.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,530
You...

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,150
l have to take it.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,530
l want to go to a good college,
so l can have a fruitful life.

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,120
Honey, you're not going
to school like this, now.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,700
Fine. What's this? What's his problem?

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,830
-He doesn't feel well.
-Yeah, right.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
Dry that one out,
you can fertilize the lawn.

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,590
Jeanie? ls that you?

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,760
Jeanie? l can't see that far.

29
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,550
Jeanie? Jeanie, l...

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,600
-Bite the big one, Junior.
-Thank you, Jeanie. You get to school.

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,190
Wait, you're letting him stay home?

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,610
l can't believe this.
lf l was bleeding out my eyes

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,280
you guys would make me go to school.
This is so unfair.

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,990
Jeanie, please don't be upset with me.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,370
You have your health. Be thankful.

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,250
That's it. l want out of this family.

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,920
l'm okay. l'll just sleep.

38
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,800
Maybe l'll have an aspirin around noon.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Now, listen,
l'm showing some houses to that,

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,140
that family from Vermont today.
So l'll be in the area.

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,810
Now, my office will know just where
l am if you need me, okay?

42
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,810
-Okay.
-Okay.

43
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,650
l'll check on you too, pal.

44
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,070
lt's nice to know
that l have such loving, caring parents.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,780
You're both very special people.

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,830
Now, you get better, pumpkin.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,950
Okay, pumpkin.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,660
l'll be home at 6:00 sharp.

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,170
lf you need anything, call.

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,040
Ringy-dingy.

51
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,180
-We love you, sweetie.
-l love you, too.

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,930
Call if you need us.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,650
They bought it.

54
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,450
lncredible.

55
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,660
One of the worst performances
of my career

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,120
and they never doubted it for a second.

57
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,260
How could l possibly be expected
to handle school on a day like this?

58
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,640
This is my ninth sick day this semester.

59
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,150
lt's getting pretty tough
coming up with new illnesses.

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,730
lf l go for 10, l'm probably
gonna have to barf up a lung.

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
So l better make this one count.

62
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,990
The key to faking out the parents
is the clammy hands.

63
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,660
lt's a good non-specific symptom.
l'm a big believer in it.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,580
A lot of people will tell you that
a good, phony fever is a dead lock.

65
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,090
But, you get a nervous mother,
you could wind up in a doctor's office.

66
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,170
That's worse than school.

67
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,340
You fake a stomach cramp

68
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,550
and when you're bent over,
moaning and wailing,

69
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,180
you lick your palms.

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,430
lt's a little childish and stupid,

71
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,940
but then, so is high school.

72
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,610
Life moves pretty fast.

73
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,740
lf you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,200
l do have a test today.
That wasn't bullshit.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
lt's on European socialism.
l mean, really, what's the point?

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,380
l'm not European.
l don't plan on being European.

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,750
So, who gives a crap
if they're socialists?

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,460
They could be fascist anarchists.

79
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,720
lt still wouldn't change the fact
that l don't own a car.

80
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,110
lt's not that l condone fascism

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,110
or any "ism," for that matter.

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,570
"lsms," in my opinion, are not good.

83
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,660
A person should not believe in an "ism,"
he should believe in himself.

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,210
l quote John Lennon, "l don't believe
in Beatles, l just believe in me."

85
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,750
A good point there.
After all, he was "The Walrus."

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,090
l could be "The Walrus."
l'd still have to bum rides off of people.

87
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,970
-Adams?
-Here.

88
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,930
-Adamley?
-Here.

89
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,260
Adamowsky?

90
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,310
-Adamson?
-Here.

91
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,190
-Adler?
-Here.

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Anderson?

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,520
-Anderson?
-Here.

94
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:11,320
Bueller?

95
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,370
-Bueller?
-He's sick.

96
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,870
My best friend's sister's
boyfriend's brother's girlfriend

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,040
heard from this guy
who knows this kid, who's going

98
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,540
with a girl who saw Ferris pass out
at Thirty-One Flavors last night.

99
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,420
l guess it's pretty serious.

100
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,930
-Thank you, Simone.
-No problem whatsoever.

101
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,600
Frye? Frye?

102
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,180
<i>Frye?</i>

103
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,650
Hello?

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,150
<i>-Cameron, babe, what's happening?
-Very little.</i>

105
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,990
<i>-How do you feel?
-Shredded.</i>

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,040
<i>ls your mother in the room?</i>

107
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,620
She's in Decatur.
Unfortunately, she's not staying.

108
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,710
Where are you?

109
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,920
l'm taking the day off.
Now get dressed and come on over.

110
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,050
<i>l can't, stupid, l'm sick.</i>

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,220
That's all in your head.

112
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,430
<i>Come on over.</i>

113
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,890
l feel like complete shit, Ferris.
l can't go anywhere.

114
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,180
l'm sorry to hear that.
Now come on over here and pick me up.

115
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,660
l'm dying.

116
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,370
<i>You're not dying. You just
can't think of anything good to do.</i>

117
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,800
lf anybody needs a day off,
it's Cameron.

118
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,720
He has a lot of things to sort out
before he graduates.

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,840
He can't be wound up this tight
and go to college.

120
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,390
His roommate will kill him.

121
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,220
<i>When Cameron was in Egypt's land</i>

122
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,150
<i>Let my Cameron go</i>

123
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,530
Pardon my French,
but Cameron is so tight

124
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,990
that if you stuck
a lump of coal up his ass,

125
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,950
in two weeks you'd have a diamond.

126
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Katie Bueller.

127
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,250
<i>This is Edward R. Rooney,
Dean of Students.</i>

128
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,300
l just completely forgot to call.

130
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,510
<i>Then you are aware that your son
is not in school today?</i>

131
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,970
<i>Yes, l am. Ferris is home, sick.</i>

132
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,680
<i>Now, l had a meeting
first thing this morning.</i>

133
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,430
<i>l know l should have called,
it just completely slipped my mind.</i>

134
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,310
<i>l'm really very sorry.</i>

135
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,020
Are you also aware, Mrs. Bueller, that

136
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,860
Ferris does not have
what we consider to be

137
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,030
an exemplary attendance record?

138
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,900
<i>l don't understand.</i>

139
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,030
He has missed an unacceptable number
of school days.

140
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,200
ln the opinion of this educator,

141
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,040
Ferris is not taking
his academic growth seriously.

142
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,580
Now, l've spent my morning
examining his records.

143
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,790
lf Ferris thinks that
he can just coast through this month

144
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,960
and still graduate,
he is sorely mistaken.

145
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,380
<i>l have no reservation, whatsoever,</i>

146
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,470
about holding him back another year.

147
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,480
-This is all news to me.
-Usually is.

148
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,400
So far this semester
he has been absent nine times.

149
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,400
-Nine times?
-Nine times.

150
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,950
l don't remember him
being sick nine times.

151
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,910
That's probably because he wasn't sick,
he was skipping school.

152
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,700
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Mrs. Bueller.

153
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,080
lt's a fool's paradise.

154
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,250
He is just leading you
down the primrose path.

155
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,590
<i>l can't believe it.</i>

156
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,960
l've got it right here in front of me.

157
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,840
He has missed nine days.

158
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,430
l asked for a car, l got a computer.

159
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,100
How's that
for being born under a bad sign?

160
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,520
Grace?

161
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,280
Grace!

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,530
Look, l can give you every assurance,
Mr. Rooney, that Ferris is home

163
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,070
and he is very ill.

164
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,700
<i>ln fact, l debated whether or not
l should even leave him.</i>

165
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,950
Grace!

166
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,580
l can appreciate how this time of year
children are prone to taking the day off.

167
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,540
However, in Ferris' case, l can
assure you, he is truly a very sick boy.

168
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,550
Never had one lesson.

169
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,310
ln 1930,

170
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,310
the Republican-controlled
House of Representatives,

171
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,150
in an effort
to alleviate the effects of the...

172
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,690
Anyone? Anyone?
The Great Depression,

173
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,860
passed the... Anyone? Anyone?

174
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,200
The tariff bill,
the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act which...

175
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,410
Anyone? Raised or lowered?

176
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,540
Raised tariffs

177
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,380
in an effort to collect more revenue
for the federal government.

178
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,920
Did it work? Anyone?
Anyone know the effects?

179
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,760
lt did not work and the United States
sank deeper into the Great Depression.

180
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,680
Today, we have
a similar debate over this.

181
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,930
Anyone know what this is?
Class? Anyone?

182
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Anyone?

183
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,350
Anyone seen this before?

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,150
The Laffer Curve.
Anyone know what this says?

185
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,980
lt says, that at this point
on the revenue curve,

186
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,990
you will get exactly
the same amount of revenue

187
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,370
as at this point.

188
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,870
This is very controversial.

189
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,790
Does anyone know what Vice President
Bush called this in 1980?

190
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,330
Anyone?

191
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,460
Something "d-o-o" economics.

192
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,670
Voodoo economics.

193
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,930
Jeanie.

194
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,230
l'm really sorry about your brother.

195
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,150
What are you sorry for?
l have to live with the trouser snake.

196
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,480
No, l mean, l heard he's really sick.

197
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,820
Whoa. Whoa. Who said he's sick?

198
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,110
A whole bunch of people. They said
he's like on the verge of death.

199
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,990
This guy in my biology class

200
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,330
said that if Ferris dies,
he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder.

201
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,410
He's such a sweetie. Got to go.

202
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
-Hi, Jeanie.
-Shut up.

203
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,500
Please, do not yank my cord on this.
How desperate is the situation?

204
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,340
Well, did you see Alien?

205
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,680
When that creature
was in that guy's stomach?

206
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,050
lt kind of feels like that.

207
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,510
Freshmen.

208
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,930
Goddamn, are you kidding?

209
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,270
No, of course l'm not kidding.
Do l sound like l'm kidding?

210
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,770
Who's he talking to?

211
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,060
Ferris Bueller, do you know him?

212
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,860
Yeah. He's getting me
out of summer school.

213
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,980
<i>We appreciate you letting us know
how you're doing.</i>

214
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,780
<i>We've got to buzz.
Keep a good thought, dude.</i>

215
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,950
Thanks.

216
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,820
Shit. l hope he doesn't die.

217
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,780
l can't handle summer school.

218
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,160
-Wait a minute, give me somebody else.
-Yeah, sure, hold on.

219
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,370
-You see Alien?
-Yeah, why?

220
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,170
<i>-Hello?
-Hi.</i>

221
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,220
Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

222
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,590
Oh, my God, you're dying?

223
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,810
-ls it serious?
-l don't know. l hope not.

224
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,020
-Think l may need a kidney transplant.
-Shit.

225
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,440
-Are you upset?
-Excuse me.

226
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
-Think you'll be alive this weekend?
-Yeah, l'd say l will.

227
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,990
Great. Maybe l'll see you. Bye.

228
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:09,930
l don't trust this kid
any further than l can throw him.

229
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,810
Well, with your bad knee, Ed,
you shouldn't throw anybody.

230
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,390
lt's true.

231
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,980
What is so dangerous about a character
like Ferris Bueller is

232
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,360
he gives good kids bad ideas.

233
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,190
The last thing l need
at this point in my career is

234
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,820
1,500 Ferris Bueller disciples
running around these halls.

235
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,240
He jeopardizes my ability
to effectively govern this student body.

236
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,950
Well, makes you look like an ass
is what he does, Ed.

237
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,370
Thank you, Grace. l think you're wrong.

238
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
Well, he's very popular, Ed.

239
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
The sportos and motorheads,
geeks, sluts,

240
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,300
bloods, wasteoids,
dweebies, dickheads,

241
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,890
they all adore him.

242
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,050
They think he's a righteous dude.

243
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,680
That is why
l have got to catch him this time.

244
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,560
To show these kids
that the example he sets

245
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,980
is a first-class ticket to nowhere.

246
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,230
Ed.

247
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,070
You sounded like Dirty Harry just then.

248
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,360
Really?

249
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,240
Thanks, Grace.

250
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,660
l'm serious, man, this is ridiculous.

251
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,540
Making me
wait around the house for you.

252
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,330
<i>Why can't you let me rot in peace?</i>

253
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,670
Cameron, this is my ninth sick day.

254
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,760
lf l get caught, l won't graduate.

255
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,550
l'm not doing this for me,
l'm doing it for you.

256
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,390
-Do you know what my diastolic is?
-Be a man.

257
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,470
Take some Pepto-Bismol,
get dressed, and come on over here.

258
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,970
-l'm tired of this stuff.
-Shut up.

259
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,690
Hold your water for a second,
l got another call.

260
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,480
-Hello?
-Ferris?

261
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,820
<i>Hi.</i>

262
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,610
You sound terrible.

263
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,530
<i>Really? Darn. l thought l was improving.</i>

264
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,200
Were you sleeping?

265
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,870
Dad, can you hang on for a second?

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,500
-Sure, pal.
-Hang on.

267
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,540
-Cameron, it's my dad.
-Great.

268
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,120
Keep me out of it.

269
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,050
lf you're not over here in 15 minutes,
you can find a new best friend.

270
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,220
You've been saying that
since the fifth grade.

271
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,430
-Dad?
-Yeah?

272
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,390
<i>All this talking
has made me kind of light-headed.</i>

273
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
l think l ought to lie down.

274
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,230
Take a hot bath and then
wrap a hot towel around your head.

275
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,360
-Wrap a hot towel around my head?
-And then

276
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,650
make yourself some soup.
Get a nap. Okay?

277
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,900
Okay.

278
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,070
<i>-Hey, Ferris?
-Yeah?</i>

279
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,660
-Love you, pal.
-l love you, too.

280
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,910
l'm so disappointed in Cameron.

281
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,670
$20 says he's sitting in his car, debating
about whether or not he should go out.

282
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,250
He'll keep calling me.

283
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,670
He'll keep calling me until l come over.

284
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,680
He'll make me feel guilty.

285
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,010
This...

286
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,430
This is ridiculous.
Okay, l'll go, l'll go, l'll go.

287
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,850
Shit.

288
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,280
Goddamn it!

289
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,490
Forget it. That's it.

290
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,170
l'm not going.

291
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,310
ln

292
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,310
what way

293
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,320
does the author's use

294
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,200
of the prison

295
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,080
symbolize

296
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,960
the protagonist's struggle? And

297
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,340
how does this relate

298
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,970
to our discussion of the uses of irony?

299
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,640
Mr. Knowlan, may l interrupt, please?

300
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,900
Sloane Peterson?

301
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,360
May l have a word with you, dear?

302
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,870
My dear, l'm afraid
that l'm the bearer of bad tidings.

303
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,250
Your father called.

304
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,750
Your grandmother has just passed.

305
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,920
-No.
-Oh, darling. Oh, honey.

306
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,050
Dead grandmother?

307
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes, that's what Mr. Peterson said.

308
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,850
l had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
Poor little lamb.

309
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,650
Who's this girl going out with?

310
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,110
lt's so hard to tell these days.

311
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,400
l do see her
with Ferris Bueller quite a little bit.

312
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Would you get me
Mr. Peterson's daytime number, please?

313
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,740
Surely.

314
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,120
<i>-Ed Rooney's office.
-This is George Peterson.</i>

315
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,080
Please hold.

316
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,380
What do you know? lt's Mr. Peterson.

317
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,260
You still want his daytime number?

318
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,600
<i>-Ed Rooney.
-Ed. This is George Peterson.</i>

319
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,680
How are you today, sir?

320
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,350
<i>We've had a bit of bad luck
this morning, as you may have heard.</i>

321
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,770
Yeah, l heard, and l'm all broken up.

322
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,480
-Boy, what a blow.
-Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,700
<i>Well, it's been a tough morning, and</i>

324
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,780
<i>we've got a lot of family business
to take care of. So</i>

325
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,370
<i>if you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
l'd appreciate it.</i>

326
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,870
Sure, l'd be happy to.

327
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,290
Yeah, you just produce a corpse, and

328
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,170
l'll release Sloane.

329
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,500
l want to see this
dead grandmother, firsthand.

330
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,590
Ed?

331
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,930
lt's all right, Grace.
lt's Ferris Bueller, the little twerp.

332
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,930
l'm gonna set the trap
and let him fall right into it.

333
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,180
<i>Ed, l'm sorry, did you say
you wanted to see a body?</i>

334
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,230
Yeah, that's right.

335
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,360
Just roll her old bones on over here,
and l'll dig up your daughter.

336
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
-You know, that's school policy.
-Oh?

337
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,950
<i>-Was this your mother?
-No, my wife's mother.</i>

338
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,080
Ed Rooney's office.

339
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,250
Hi, this is Ferris Bueller,
can l speak to Mr. Rooney, please?

340
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,500
Thank you.

341
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,630
Hold.

342
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,250
Tell you what, dip-shit,

343
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,920
you don't like my policies
you can just come on down here, and

344
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,680
smooch my big old white butt.

345
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,140
-Ed.
-Pucker up, buttercup. What?

346
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,350
Ferris Bueller's on line two.

347
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,110
<i>Hey, Mr. Rooney, how you doing?</i>

348
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,740
<i>Listen, l'm sorry to disturb you at work,
but l'm not feeling very well today</i>

349
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,950
and l was wondering if it might be
possible for my sister to bring home

350
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,870
any assignments from my classes
that l might need.

351
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,540
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

352
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,470
Mr. Peterson?

353
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,810
l think l owe you an apology, sir.

354
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,650
-Well, l should say you do.
-l...

355
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,400
l, l, l...

356
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,320
Well, l think you should be sorry,
for Christ's sake.

357
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,150
A family member dies

358
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,700
and you insult me. What the hell
is the matter with you anyway?

359
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,030
Well...

360
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,580
l really don't know, sir.

361
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,500
<i>l mean, l didn't think
l was talking to you.</i>

362
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>l thought l was talking
to somebody else.</i>

363
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,460
You know, sir, that l would never
deliberately insult you like that. l...

364
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,960
l can't begin to tell you
how embarrassed l am.

365
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,470
-What?
-Pardon my French,

366
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,880
but you're an asshole.

367
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,090
-What do you want?
-Asshole.

368
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,470
Absolutely right, sir.
You've hit the nail right on the head.

369
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,100
Find out where she is.

370
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,770
This isn't over yet, buster.
Do you read me?

371
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,020
Loud and clear, Mr. Peterson.

372
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,230
Call me "sir," goddamn it!

373
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,280
-Yes, sir, yes, sir.
-That's better.

374
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,320
And you just mind
your p's and q's, buster.

375
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,660
And remember who you're dealing with.

376
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,530
Bueller, Ferris Bueller.

377
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,460
Now, l'm a little scared 'cause
what if he recognizes my voice?

378
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,540
-lmpossible. You're doing great.
-Yeah?

379
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,050
She's in... Wait.

380
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,130
Rooney!

381
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,220
Rooney, calm down!

382
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,640
Just a moment.

383
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,310
Ed! Get in here!

384
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,400
Just a little office difficulty, sir.

385
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,070
Rooney, l don't have all day
to bark at you.

386
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,650
So l'm gonna make this
short and sweet.

387
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,280
lt's great. Perfect. l love it.

388
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,820
l want my daughter out in front of the
school in 10 minutes by herself.

389
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,700
l don't want anybody... What?

390
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,660
lt's too suspicious.
He'll think something's up.

391
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,750
-Cover it.
-You.

392
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,960
-Talk.
-You.

393
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,330
-Talk.
-Come on.

394
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,710
Talk. No.

395
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,210
Rooney! Rooney.

396
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,550
Yes, yes.

397
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,340
Listen here, pay attention.
l changed my mind.

398
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,840
l want you out
in front of the school with her.

399
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,390
l'd like to have a few words with you,
by God.

400
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,720
On second thought,
we don't have time to talk right now.

401
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,350
We'll get together soon
and we'll have lunch.

402
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,690
What the hell is wrong with you?

403
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,650
Wait.

404
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,740
-Where's your brain?
-Why'd you kick me?

405
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,200
-Where's your brain?
-l asked you first.

406
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,120
How can we pick up Sloane
if Rooney is there with her?

407
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,460
l said for her to be there alone
and you freaked.

408
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,630
Now, l didn't... l didn't hit you.
l lightly slapped you.

409
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,550
You hit me.

410
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,350
Look, don't ask me
to participate in your stupid crap

411
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,560
if you don't like the way l do it.

412
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,270
You make me get out of bed.
You make me come over here.

413
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,400
You make me make a phony phone call
to Edward Rooney?

414
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,610
The man could squash my nuts
into oblivion, and then,

415
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,070
and then,
you deliberately hurt my feelings.

416
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,370
No, l did not deliberately...
l didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.

417
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,950
-Really?
-Really, no. No, l didn't.

418
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,250
What are you doing?

419
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,000
See you later, pal, l'm going home.

420
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,050
-No, no, come on, don't do that.
-Have a nice life.

421
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,260
Cameron, wait a minute.
Cameron, come back.

422
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,340
l didn't mean to lose my temper.
l'm sorry. lt was uncalled for.

423
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,850
-You serious?
-Yeah.

424
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,980
Here you go.

425
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,570
Thank you.

426
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,990
You did screw up, though, right?

427
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,160
l mean, not that it was
completely your fault.

428
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,620
-Why?
-Well,

429
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,750
to fix the situation

430
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,630
l'm gonna have to
ask you for a small favor.

431
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,400
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California.

432
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,530
Less than 100 were made.

433
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,160
My father spent
three years restoring this car.

434
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,500
lt is his love, it is his passion...

435
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,840
lt is his fault he didn't lock the garage.

436
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,170
Ferris, what are you talking about?

437
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,930
Ferris, my father loves this car
more than life itself.

438
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,350
A man with priorities so far out of whack
doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.

439
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,400
No. No.

440
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,440
<i>-Apparently you don't understand.
-Wow.</i>

441
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,700
Ferris, he never drives it.

442
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,110
He just rubs it with a diaper.

443
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,200
Hey, remember how insane he went
when l broke my retainer?

444
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,250
Come on, that was a little piece
of plastic, this is a Ferrari.

445
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,510
Cameron, l'm sorry,
but we can't pick up Sloane in your car.

446
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,390
Mr. Rooney would never believe
Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit.

447
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,390
-lt's not a piece of shit.
-lt is a piece of shit.

448
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,770
Don't worry about it, l don't even have
a piece of shit, l have to envy yours.

449
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,150
Thanks.

450
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,570
Look, l'm sorry,
there's nothing else we can do.

451
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,750
-He knows the mileage, Ferris.
-He doesn't trust you?

452
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,750
-Never has, never will.
-Look, this is real simple.

453
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,090
Whatever miles we put on,
we'll take off.

454
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,590
-How?
-We'll drive home backwards.

455
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,050
No. No!

456
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,350
Ferris, forget it. You're just gonna
have to think of something else.

457
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,140
l'm putting my foot down.

458
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,770
How about we rent a nice Cadillac?
My treat.

459
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,150
We could call a limo!

460
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,280
A nice stretch job with a TV and a bar.

461
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,740
How about that?

462
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,120
Come on, live a little.

463
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,920
Once again, let me tell you how deeply
saddened l am by your loss. l...

464
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,130
l had a grandmother, once.

465
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,550
Two, actually.

466
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,090
<i>Deficits. Who will have to pay that

l'll take grief.

Great.

Oh, Sloane, dear.

Hurry along now.

-Yeah.
-Gotta go.

480
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,860
Mr. Rooney...

481
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,820
-Ed, you're a beautiful man.
-Thank you.

482
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,530
l wanna thank you
for your warmth and compassion.

<i>Higher marginal rates on your taxes.
Any questions so far?</i>

Shit.

-Hi.
-Do you have a kiss for Daddy?

487

Are you kidding?

488
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,570
So, that's how it is in their family.

489
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,530
-Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?
-Hi, Sloane. No.

490
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,450
What are we gonna do?

491
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,080
The question isn't:
What are we going to do?

492
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,040
The question is:
What aren't we going to do?

493
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,880
Don't say we're not going
to take the car home.

494
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,170
Please don't say we're not going
to take the car home.

495
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
lf you had access to a car like this,

496
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,470
would you take it back right away?

497
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,010
Neither would l.

498
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,460
Hey, Ferris, don't go so fast!

499
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,300
-Red line, red line, red line.
-Ferris, get out!

500
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,570
Thank you.

501
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,690
Save Ferris.

502
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,110
God loves you, you're very generous.

503
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,860
Save Ferris, save Ferris.

504
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,780
Save Ferris Bueller. Save Ferris.

505
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,870
-Save Ferris?
-What?

506
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,910
Well, see, we're collecting money
to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

507
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,210
and they run about $50,000,
so if you could help out...

508
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,090
-Go piss up a flagpole.
-l'm sorry?

509
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,130
-You should be.
-Hey...

510
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,840
Hey! Hey...

511
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,220
What if you need a favor someday

512
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,220
from Ferris Bueller?
Then where will you be, huh?

513
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,800
You heartless wench.

514
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,890
Peterson home on line one.

515
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,730
-And watch your mouth this time.
-Go soak your head.

516
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,230
<i>We can't come to the phone right now.</i>

517

<i>We've had a death in the family.</i>

518
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,110
Grace,

519
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,110
Ferris Bueller's behind this.
There is no doubt in my mind.

520
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,870
And now he's got Sloane Peterson
involved in this thing.

521
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,790
Her grandmother, too.

522
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,660
You pinhead.

523
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,920
<i>lf you need to reach us we'll be
at the following number.</i>

524
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,920
Okay.

525
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,430
l did not achieve this position in life
by having some snot-nosed punk

526
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,350
leave my cheese out in the wind.

527
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,100
<i>You have reached
the Coughlin Brothers Mortuary.</i>

528
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,020
<i>We are deeply sorry we are unable
to come to the phone right now,</i>

529
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,770
<i>but if you leave your name and number,</i>

530
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,770
<i>we'll get back to you
as soon as is humanly possible.</i>

531
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,410
Something's going on, goddamn it.

532
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,870
And l'm gonna find out what it is.

533
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,450
l'm gonna catch this kid and l'm gonna
put one hell of a dent in his future.

534
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,960
Fifteen years from now when he looks
back on the ruin his life's become,

535
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,460
he is going to remember
Edward Rooney.

536
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,360
-Wrong.
-What?

537
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,320
Not here.

538
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,160
We're not leaving the car here.

539
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,030
-Why not?
-Because we're not.

540
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,330
l want the car back home
where it belongs, right now.

541
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,410
Come on, let's go.

542
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Cameron, what's gonna happen to it?
lt's in a garage.

543
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,000
lt could get wrecked, stolen, scratched,

544
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,380
breathed on wrong, a pigeon
could shit on it. Who knows?

545
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,550
Listen, will you calm down, please?

546
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,930
l'm gonna give the guy $5 to watch it.

547
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,470
What guy?

548
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,190
Hey, how you doing?

549
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,690
Do you speak English?

550
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,990
What country do you think this is?

551
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,740
Okay. Listen,

552
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,580
l want you to take extra
special care of this vehicle. Okay?

553
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,370
-Hey, no problem.
-Great.

554
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,870
Trust me.

555
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,210
-Sir?
-Come on.

556
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,790
Come.

557
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,350
Relax.

558
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,070
You fellows have nothing
to worry about. l'm a professional.

559
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,360
Professional what?

560
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,580
See what a finski can do
to a guy's attitude?

561
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,710
Cameron, come on.

562
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,500
Come on, come on.

563
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,890
Paper?

564
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,440
Hey, look at that.

565
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Go! Go!

566
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,200
Bless his little heart.

567
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,840
<i>Nine times.</i>

568
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,770
-Ferris, you think the car's all right?
-Sure.

569
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,680
This is the world's tallest building.

570
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,190
Ferris, l don't feel too good.
Can we leave soon?

571
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,980
1,353 feet up in the air...

572
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,900
Here, climb up on this.

573
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,030
Come on, everybody.

574
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,610
Cameron.

575
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,330
Okay, now

576
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,240
lean forward against the glass like this.

577
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,620
Oh, my God.

578
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,080
lsn't that great?

579
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,920
The city looks so peaceful from up here.

580
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,090
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet.

581
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,180
l think l see my dad.

582
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,390
We got a lot to do, let's go.

583
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,270
Shit.

584
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,270
The son of a bitch
is down there somewhere.

585
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,880
-You want to get married?
-Sure.

586
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,220
Today?

587
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,880
l'm serious.

588
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,310
-l'm not getting married.
-Why not?

589
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,140
What do you mean, "Why not?"
Think about it.

590
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,810
Well, no, besides being too young,

591
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,650
having no place to live,

592
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,980
you feeling a little awkward about being
the only cheerleader with a husband,

593
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,030
give me one good reason why not.

594
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,660
l'll give you two good reasons why not:
my mother and my father.

595
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,700
They're married
and they hate each other.

596
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,120
You've seen them. Am l right?

597
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,790
-So what?
-Well, it's like that car.

598
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,920
He loves the car. He hates his wife.

599
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,550
Thank you.

600
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,530
Can we please get the hell out of here?

601
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
This place gives me the creeps.

602
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,490
Why didn't you tell me
we were coming to a...

603
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,790
-Hello, may l help you?
-You can sure as hell try.

604
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,540
Hi. l'm Abe Froman.

607
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,260
-You are Abe Froman?
-That's right. l'm Abe Froman.

608
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,390
The sausage king of Chicago?

609
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,560
Yeah. That's me.

610
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,890
Listen, young man,

611
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,810
entre nous, l'm very busy here.

612
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,150
Why don't you take the kids
and go back to the clubhouse?

613
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,820
Are you suggesting
that l'm not who l say l am?

614
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,950
l'm suggesting that you leave
before l have to get snooty.

615
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,620
-Snooty?
-Snotty.

616
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,620
-Snotty?
-Okay, Abe, let's go.

617
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,250
No, l'm not going anywhere.
No, we'd like to be seated.

618
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,920
Listen, young man,
either you take the field trip outside

619
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,750
or l'm going to have to call the police.

620
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
The...

621
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,380
-You're gonna call the police on me?
-Yes.

622
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,470
Fine. As a matter of fact,
l'll call them myself.

623
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,430
Yes. Call the police.

624
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,180
This'll be a hoot.

625
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,230
Here, give me the phone.
l have another call.

626
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
-No.
-l've had enough of this horsing around.

627
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,280
-Give me the phone back.
-You touch me, l yell, "Rat."

628
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,700
There's another phone
around here somewhere. Find it.

629
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,450
Wonderful.

630
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,120
l weep for the future.

631
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,590
Okay, Ferris,
can we just let it go, please?

632
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,170
Ferris, please. You've gone too far.
You're gonna get busted.

633
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,470
A: You can never go too far.

634
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,140
B: lf l'm gonna get busted,
it is not gonna be by a guy like that.

635
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,600
Come on, "Abe."

636
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,640
Ask for Abe Froman.

637
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,980
<i>-Chez Quis, bonjour.
-May l speak to Abe Froman,</i>

638
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,360
<i>-the sausage king of Chicago?
-Abe Froman?</i>

639
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,240
Let me check the restaurant.

640
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,740
Could you describe him for me, please?

641
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,950
Leather jacket,
white T-shirt, sweater vest.

642
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,120
He's devastatingly handsome.

643
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,330
<i>-Hold on one moment.
-Yes, thank you.</i>

644
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,770
Mr. Froman, this is
Sergeant Peterson, Chicago Police.

645
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,320
-l appreciate your understanding.
-Don't think twice.

646
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,240
lt's understanding that makes it possible

647
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,360
for people like us
to tolerate a person like yourself.

648
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,040
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

649
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,710
Enjoy your lunch.

650
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,920
Darling, you were wonderful.

651
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,930
Cameron, dear friend,

652
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,900
you thought we wouldn't have any fun.
Shame on you.

653
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,780
<i>Maybe l'm overreacting.</i>

654
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,570
<i>Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.</i>

655
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,740
<i>After all, l got a car. He got a computer.</i>

656
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,120
<i>But still,</i>

657
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,580
<i>why should he get to do whatever
he wants, whenever he wants?</i>

658
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,590
<i>Why should
everything work out for him?</i>

659
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,920
<i>What makes him so goddamn special?</i>

660
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,550
Screw him.

661
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,260
<i>l used to think that my family was
the only one that had weirdness in it.</i>

662
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,760
That used to worry me.

663
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,100
Then l saw
how Cameron's family functioned.

664
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
His home life is really twisted.

665
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,940
That's why he's sick all the time.
lt really bothers him.

666
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,570
<i>He's the only guy l know
who feels better when he's sick.</i>

667
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,950
lf l had to live in that house,
l'd probably pray for disease, too.

668
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,290
<i>The place is like a museum.</i>

669
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,910
lt's very beautiful and very cold

670
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,790
and you're not allowed
to touch anything.

671
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,290
<i>Can you appreciate
what it must have been like</i>

672
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,170
for Cameron
to be in that joint as a baby?

673
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,720
<i>l'm actually amazed
that l got the car out of the garage.</i>

674
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,310
<i>l caught Cameron digging the ride
once or twice.</i>

675
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,220
lt's good for him.

676
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,560
lt teaches him to deal with his fear.

677
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,980
Plus, and l must be honest here,

678
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,610
l love driving it. lt is so choice.

679
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,280
lf you have the means,
l highly recommend picking one up.

680
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,280
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

681
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,580
Mint.

682
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,220
Well, hello, Jeanie.
Who's bothering you now?

683
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,720
ls Mr. Rooney in?

684
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,220
No, l'm sorry, he's not. Can l help you?

685
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,600
l seriously doubt it. When's he back?

686
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,100
l don't know.

687
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,060
He's left the school grounds
on personal business.

688
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,940
What's that supposed to mean?

689
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,030
l suppose it means it's personal and
it's none of your business, young lady.

690
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,030
Nice attitude.

691
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,820
lsn't Mrs. Hagel
expecting you in consumer ed. class?

692
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,160
Probably.

693
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,170
What a little asshole.

694
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,250
Dave, you've got to consider
raising your advertising budget.

695
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,920
-We don't have the money.
-Dave,

696
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,380
if you wanna sell, you have to spend.
lt's as simple as that.

697
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,550
Four thousand restaurants
in the downtown area.

698
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,260
l pick the one my father goes to.

699
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,810
-We're pinched, for sure.
-No way, Cameron.

700
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,560
Only the meek get pinched.
The bold survive.

701
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,190
Let's go.

702
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,770
-Let's surrender.
-Never.

703
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,780
Dave, l know it sounds like
l'm beating a dead horse on this one.

704
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,620
But l'm telling you,
that that's not the case.

705
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,240
We don't have the money.
We don't have the...

706
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,580
Dave, you're one of the
brightest guys in this business.

707
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,460
You know what it takes
to push this over the top.

708
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,670
We're gonna go heavy on TV

709
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,500
and lighten up on the radio
and the print. Okay?

710
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,750
-He's got the money.
-Look, come on back to my office.

711
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,550
-l'll lay out the entire...
-He's got the money.

712
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,630
Dave, we know you've got the money.

713
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,760
We just have to spend it.
That's all, you bonehead.

714
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,070
<i>Bueller.</i>

715
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:45,670
<i>Les jeux sont faits.
Translation: The game is up.</i>

716
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,340
Your ass is mine.

717
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,530
<i>Runner at first base, nobody out.</i>

718
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,790
<i>That's the first hit they've had
since the fifth inning,</i>

719
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,620
<i>only the fourth hit in the game.</i>

720
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,210
<i>0 and 2, the count.</i>

721
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,250
<i>There's a drive,</i>

722
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,430
<i>left field, twisting, and into foul territory.</i>

723
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,810
<i>Boy, l'm really surprised
they didn't go for it in that inning.</i>

724
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,770
<i>Lee Smith.</i>

725
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,980
-What's the score?
-Nothing, nothing.

726
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,730
Who's winning?

727
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,400
The Bears.

728
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,730
<i>There's the ball,
bunted foul back to the screen.</i>

729
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,320
<i>Boy, l don't know...</i>

730
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,670
Think l broke my thumb.

731
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,590
Hey batter, batter, batter, batter, batter,
swing, batter. Come on.

732
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,960
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter,
swing, batter.

733
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,760
He can't hit, he can't hit, he can't hit,
swing, batter.

734
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,680
Hey, Cameron.

735
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,190
Do you realize if we played by the rules,
right now we'd be in gym?

736
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,610
Keep moving, keep moving.

737
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,230
You're up now.

738
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,070
Come on,
get the piano off that back. Let's go.

739
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,610
Come on, boys, let's go.

740
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,830
You'll never get out of here. Move!

741
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,540
Come on, move!

742
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,960

Hi, doggie.

Stay, boy.

No, no. Stay. Stay.

Sit.

780
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,900
Heel. Stay.

781
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,440
<i>And passing the reviewing stand now,</i>

782
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,690
Silbernen Ritter Drum and Bugle Corps.

783
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,910
<i>The United German-American
Male and Female Caucus.</i>

784
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,240
<i>The Empire German-Americans.</i>

785
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,830
lt's getting late, buddy,
we better go get the car back home.

786
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,920
-What?
-What do you...

787
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,130
We have a few hours.
We have until 6:00.

788
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,220
l'm sorry, l mean, l know you
don't care, but it does mean my ass.

789
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,010
-You think l don't care?
-l know you don't care.

790
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,470
Oh, that hurts, Cameron.

791
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,310
-Cameron, what have you seen today?
-Nothing good.

792
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,270
Nothing...

793
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,270
Nothing good? This...

794
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,190
What do you mean, "Nothing good"?
We've seen everything good!

795
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,030
We've seen the whole city!

796
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,320
We went to a museum,
we saw priceless works of art.

797
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,790
We ate pancreas.

798
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,000
Saw... What?

799
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,210
What's wrong?

800
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,800
Look over there.

801
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,040
What's he doing?

802
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,710
He's licking the glass and making
obscene gestures with his hands.

803
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,960
What?

804
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,430
Don't! Don't.

805
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,790
He didn't leave.
He's probably doing something.

806
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,130
No, it really busts my hump, you know?

807
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:42,300
Oh, Cameron, he didn't ditch us
or anything. He's here.

808
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,550
For all we know,
he went back to school.

809
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,800
He would not go back to school.

810
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,140
Yeah, he'd do it.
He'd just do it just to make me sweat.

811
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,970
No, he would not. Cameron, come on.

812
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,430
Makes me mad.

813
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you're such a wonderful crowd.</i>

814
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,860
<i>We'd like to play a little tune for you.</i>

815
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,150
<i>lt's one of my personal favorites</i>

816
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,240
<i>and l'd like to dedicate it
to a young man</i>

817
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,160
<i>who doesn't think
he's seen anything good today.</i>

818
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,820
<i>Cameron Frye, this one's for you.</i>

819
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:18,710
-Ferris! Get off of the float!
-What are you doing?

820
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,340
Get off the float! l can't believe you.

821
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,630
How'd you get up there?
You're out of your mind!

822
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,840
You know, as long as l've known him
everything works for him.

823
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,760
There's nothing he can't handle.
l can't handle anything.

824
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,760
School, parents, the future...

825
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,310
Ferris can do anything.

826
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,690
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

827
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,150
-College.
-Yeah. But to do what?

828
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,370
What are you interested in?

829
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,540
Nothing.

830
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,040
Me neither.

831
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,970
You're crazy!

832
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,640
What do you think Ferris is gonna do?

833
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,020
He's gonna be a fry cook at Venus.

834
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,240
Christ.

835
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,960
Poochie, poochie, poochie.

836
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,710
Look what Uncle Ed has for you,
you little fucker.

837
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,970
Jeez.

838
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,430
Sleep tight, pooch.

839
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,960
l knew it!

840
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,100
Well, where is she?

841
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,940
Look, this is her daughter.

842
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
Well, do you know where she is?

843
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,740
Do you know when she'll be back?

844
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,740
Do you know anything?

845
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,290
Ferris.

846
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,000
Bueller.

847
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
-Ha!
-Ya!

848
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,690
You're psychotic. You are, man.

849
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,320
You're out of your goddamn mind.
l can't believe you did that.

850
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,530
l can't believe you went
on a goddamn parade float!

851
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,570
Okay, okay, wait. No, okay, wait. Okay.

852
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,870
"Yeah, yeah. This tune is one of
my personal favorites."

853
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,870
You're out of your mind.

854
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,710
Do you realize
how many people saw you?

855
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:54,960
-You're nailed.
-No, no.

856
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,290
-You are. You're nailed.
-You are.

857
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,090
Who'd believe that l was in a parade?
Who the hell am l?

858
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:01,670
Besides, anybody who would nail me
wouldn't go to a parade.

859
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,720
-My mother would.
-l'm not worried about your mother.

860
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,470
That was so quick.

861
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Hey.

862
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,430
This looks okay to me, Cameron.

863
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,400
Looks great, let's roll.

864
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,230
Here you go. Nice job. Thank you.

865
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,190
You're a very generous individual.
Come back anytime.

866
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,280
-Right, okay. Watch the seat.
-Thanks a lot.

867
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,700
Sorry.

868
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,330
-Have a good night.
-Bye, you guys.

869
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,460
-Yeah, see you later.
-Later.

870
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,010
Yeah, man, we gotta do this again.

871
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:49,390
Look, this...
This is not a phony phone call.

872
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:53,600
There is an intruder, male,
Caucasian, possibly armed,

873
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,270
certainly weird, in my kitchen.

874
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,810
Yeah, my, my... My name's Bueller.

875
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,240
lt's real nice that
you hope my brother's feeling better,

876
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,450
but l'm in danger, okay? l am very cute.

877
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,240
l am very alone.
And l'm very protective of my body.

878
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,160
l do not want it violated,
or killed, all right?

879
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,000
l need help!

880
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,210
Speak-a de English?

881
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,960
Dickhead.

882
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,430
God.

883
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,390
<i>Excuse me.</i>

884
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,480
<i>Whoever's in the house
is still in the house,</i>

885
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,060
<i>l'd like you to know that
l've just called the police.</i>

886
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,850
<i>So if you have any brains whatsoever,</i>

887
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,650
<i>you'll get your ass out of
my house real quick.</i>

888
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,650
<i>l'd also like to add
that l have my father's gun</i>

889
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,740
<i>and a scorching case of herpes.</i>

890
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:00,000
Hey, wait, wait, wait. That's my car!
l'll move it!

891
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,090
He got my keys!

892
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,510
You shithead!

893
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,560
l feel pretty good.

894
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:23,610
-Yeah?
-l feel real good.

895
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:26,650
Those guys... Those guys were nice,
huh? At the garage.

896
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,530
l was a little worried about them.

897
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,530
Turned out good.

898
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,830
Hey.

899
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:42,540
-Cameron?
-Yeah?

900
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,300
How many miles did you say
this thing had on it when we left?

901
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,590
One hundred and twenty-six

902
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,680
and halfway between
three and four-tenths.

903
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,800
Why?

904
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:57,390
How many miles are on it now?

905
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,690
Here's where Cameron goes berserk.

906
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,840
Cameron. Are you okay? Cam?

907
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,340
Cameron, cut that out.

908
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,010
<i>Who is it?</i>

909
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,970
<i>Oh, l'm sorry.
l can't come to the door right now.</i>

910
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,430
<i>l'm afraid that
in my weakened condition,</i>

911
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,520
<i>l could take a nasty spill
down the stairs and subject myself...</i>

912
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,520
God bless the police.

913
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,730
l'm saved. Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you. You are the best.

914
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,280
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

915
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,360
Thank...

916
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:56,030
l heard that you were feeling ill.

917
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,330
Headache, fever, and a chill.

918
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:02,910
l came to help restore your pluck

919
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,460
'cause l'm the nurse who likes to...

920
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,720
This may very well be for real.

921
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,600
l think Cameron might have blown
a microchip or two.

922
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:22,140
He's always been a little keyed up.

923
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,140
All l wanted to do
was give him a good day.

924
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,570
We're gonna graduate
in a couple of months and then

925
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:33,190
we'll have the summer.
He'll work and l'll work.

926
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,240
We'll see each other at night
and on the weekends.

927
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:40,790
Then he'll go to one school
and l'll go to another.

928
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,830
Basically that will be it.

929
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,090
Sloane's as big a problem.

930
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,760
She still has another year
of high school.

931
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,550
How do l deal with that?

932
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,180
l was serious when l said
l would marry her.

933
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,850
l would.

934
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,850
Cameron? Cam?

935
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,180
Can you hear me?

936
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,400
Cameron?

937
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,940
Blink if you understand me.

938
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,860
Cameron has never been in love.

939
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,610
At least nobody's ever been
in love with him.

940
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:23,370
lf things don't change for him,
he's gonna marry the first girl he lays.

941
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,710
And she's gonna treat him like shit

942
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:30,630
because she will have given him
what he has built up in his mind

943
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,590
as the end-all,
be-all of human existence.

944
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,880
She won't respect him.

945
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,760
'Cause you can't respect somebody
who kisses your ass.

946
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,100
Just doesn't work.

947
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:45,390
Ferris. We better try something else.

948
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,390
This isn't working.

949
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,480
You feeling any better, Cameron?

950
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:01,370
Cam, why don't you come in here?
lt's really nice.

951
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:08,000
Cameron, l could flip out real easy, too.

952
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,960
lt's okay.

953
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,130
Sooner or later
everybody goes to the zoo.

954
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,510
Maybe he's really sick.

955
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,930
Maybe he isn't just torturing himself.

956
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,140
Hey.

957
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,940
Hey, hey.

958
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:13,980
Hey, Cameron.

959
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,520
Cam. Cameron, wake up!

960
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,730
Come on, wake up. Hey, wake up.

961
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,740
Oh, shit, Cameron, come on. Cameron!

962
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,280
Come on, wake up!

963
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,780
Hey.

964
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,250
What is that?

965
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:32,160
Ferris Bueller, you're my hero.

966
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,000
-You're kidding?
-Wow, that was pretty impressive, man.

967
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,130
You bitch. Oh, you son of a bitch.

968
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,220
Come on.

969
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,470
Tarzan.

970
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,640
Sheena!

971
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,580
Drugs?

972
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,130
Thank you, no. l'm straight.

973
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:23,420
l meant, are you in here for drugs?

974
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,720
-Why are you here?
-Drugs.

975
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,520
l don't know why l'm here.

976
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,560
Why don't you go home?

977
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:36,730
Why don't you put
your thumb up your butt?

978
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,650
You wear too much eye make-up.

979
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,950
My sister wears too much.

980
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,410
People think she's a whore.

981
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,590
You don't wanna
talk about your problem?

982
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,720
-With you? Are you serious?
-l'm serious.

983
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,050
Blow yourself.

984
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:14,770
All right,
you wanna know what's wrong?

985
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,600
l know what's wrong.

986
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,230
l just wanna hear you say it.

987
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,980
ln a nutshell, l hate my brother.

988
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:25,280
-How's that?
-That's cool.

989
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,820
Did you blow him away or something?

990
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,490
No, not yet.

991
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,620
See, l went home
to confirm that the shithead

992
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,710
was ditching school
and when l was there,

993
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,290
a guy broke into the house.

994
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,090
l called the cops and they picked me up
for making a phony phone call.

995
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,920
What do you care
if your brother ditches school?

996
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,180
Why should he get to ditch,
when everybody else has to go?

997
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,850
-You could ditch.
-Yeah, l'd get caught.

998
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,310
l see.

999
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:00,770
So you're pissed off 'cause he ditches
and doesn't get caught, is that it?

1000
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,650
-Basically.
-Basically.

1001
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:09,320
Then your problem is you.

1002
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:12,030
-Excuse me?
-Excuse you.

1003
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,240
You ought to spend a little more time
dealing with yourself

1004
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,500
a little less time worrying about
what your brother does.

1005
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,420
That's just an opinion.

1006
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,420
-What are you, a psychiatrist?
-No.

1007
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:26,090
Then why don't you keep
your opinions to yourself?

1008
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,510
There's somebody you should talk to.

1009
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:40,560
lf you say "Ferris Bueller,"
you lose a testicle.

1010
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,770
Oh, you know him?

1011
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,870
You know, that whole time
l was just thinking things over.

1012
01:19:56,950 --> 01:20:00,540
l was, like... l was, like, meditating.

1013
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,590
Then l sort of watched myself
from inside.

1014
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,880
l realized it was ridiculous

1015
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:16,470
being afraid, worrying about everything,

1016
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,100
wishing l was dead. All that shit.
l'm tired of it.

1017
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:25,730
lt's the best day of my life.

1018
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,240
l'm gonna miss you guys next year.

1019
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,920
Cameron? Can l ask you a question?

1020
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,050
Yeah.

1021
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:54,260
Did you see me change out
of my clothes by the Jacuzzi?

1022
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,260
Did you?

1023
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:01,890
You saw me?

1024
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,940
l thought you were catatonic.

1025
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:11,110
That's okay.

1026
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,860
l'm not embarrassed.

1027
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,910
l better check on the car.

1028
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:34,010
Hey, Ferris!

1029
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,720
Yeah?

1030
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:41,720
The miles aren't coming off.

1031
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,810
The miles aren't coming off
going in reverse.

1032
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,820
Well, l thought that might be a problem.

1033
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,780
Just have to crack open the odometer,
roll it back by hand.

1034
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,740
No. Forget it.

1035
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,000
Forget it.

1036
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,840
l gotta take a stand.

1037
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:18,930
l'm bullshit.

1038
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,180
l put up with everything.

1039
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,230
My old man pushes me around.

1040
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:37,200
l never say anything!

1041
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,580
Well, he's not the problem.
l'm the problem.

1042
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,250
l gotta take a stand.

1043
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,930
l gotta take a stand against him.

1044
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,600
l am not gonna sit on my ass

1045
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,730
as the events that affect me unfold
to determine the course of my life.

1046
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:10,440
l'm gonna take a stand.

1047
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,860
l'm gonna defend it.

1048
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,440
Right or wrong, l'm gonna defend it.

1049
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,710
l'm so sick of his shit!

1050
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:35,960
l can't stand him,
and l hate this goddamn car.

1051
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:39,380
Who do you love? Who do you love?
You love a car.

1052
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,010
You son of a bitch.

1053
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,040
Shit.

1054
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,830
l dented the shit out of it.

1055
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,710
Good.

1056
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,640
My father will come home,
he'll see what l did. l can't hide this.

1057
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:31,020
He'll come home, he'll see what l did.
He'll have to deal with me.

1058
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:34,100
l don't care, l really don't.

1059
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,900
l'm just tired of being afraid.

1060
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,490
Hell with him.

1061
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:53,290
l can't wait to see the look
on the bastard's face.

1062
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,530
What'd l do?

1063
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:39,880
-What'd l do?
-You killed the car.

1064
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,630
Whoa.

1065
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,260
Holy shit.

1066
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,110
Cameron, it's my fault.

1067
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:41,940
l'll take the heat for it.

1068
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,480
We'll wait for your father to come home

1069
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,490
and when he gets here,
l'll tell him that l did it.

1070
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:46,990
He hates me anyway.

1071
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,500
No. l'll take it.

1072
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,120
No, l'll take it.

1073
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:00,040
No. No, you don't want this much heat.

1074
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,670
l want it. lf l didn't want it,

1075
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,880
l wouldn't have let you
take the car out this morning.

1076
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,260
l made you take the car this morning.

1077
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,970
l could've stopped you.

1078
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:11,180
lt is possible to stop
Mr. Ferris Bueller, you know?

1079
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,180
No, l want it. l'm gonna take it. That's it.

1080
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:17,640
When Morris comes home,

1081
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,940
he and l'll just have a little chat.

1082
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,020
lt's cool.

1083
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,820
No, it's gonna be good.

1084
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,910
Thanks anyway.

1085
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,420
This is a shock to me.

1086
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,090
l mean, first of all, l don't know
why she wasn't in school.

1087
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,340
And second of all, l just can't believe

1088
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,920
she came to you
with this story about an intruder.

1089
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:52,090
Well, for whatever reason she did it,
l think she's had a pretty good scare.

1090
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,100
Well, l really appreciate your calling me.
Really.

1091
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:57,140
l can assure you that her father
and l are going

1092
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,270
to have a long talk
with her when we get home.

1093
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,730
Thank you so much.

1094
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,770
Oh, by the way,
l hope your son is feeling better.

1095
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,190
l beg your pardon?

1096
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,190
Tell him all the guys
at the station here are pulling for him.

1097
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,240
Oh, right.

1098
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,210
-Hi.
-Don't "hi" me, young lady.

1099
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:25,500
-l wanna get out of here, now, all right?
-Okay.

1100
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,170
No, now. Let's get out of here.

1101
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,920
-Okay.
-Okay?

1102
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,010
-Yes.
-Now.

1103
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,090
Fine.

1104
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:32,630
Okay.

1105
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:41,060
-She's a little hyper.
-Yeah.

1106
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:48,070
Let's not ruin this
with a lot of talk, all right? Okay?

1107
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,490
You didn't tell me your name.

1108
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:57,330
Well, it's Jean,
but, a lot of guys call me Shauna.

1109
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:59,750
Okay, Jean.

1110
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:01,330
Cool.

1111
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,080
That's great.

1112
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:06,790
l'll see you, okay?

1113
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Yeah.

1114
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,090
Jeanie, now!

1115
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:18,220
-Now!
-Okay!

1116
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,900
l had a great time today.

1117
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:31,320
Yeah. lt was pretty cool.

1118
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:36,240
Do you...
Do you think Cameron's gonna be okay?

1119
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,370
Oh, yeah.

1120
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,620
Yeah, sure. For the first time in his life.

1121
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,620
He's gonna be just fine.

1122
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:54,470
You knew what you were doing when
you woke up this morning, didn't you?

1123
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:57,640
Me? No.

1124
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:20,910
Oh, shit. l have to go.

1125
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,910
-l'll call you tonight.
-Okay.

1126
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,670
-l love you!
-l love you, too!

1127
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:35,340
He's gonna marry me.

1128
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:41,810
Do you know what it's like
to be pulled out of work

1129
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:44,310
to pick up your daughter
at the police station?

1130
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:45,430
No, not really.

1131
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,020
Well, on top of everything else,

1132
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,480
l was about to close the damn deal
with the Vermont people.

1133
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:52,110
l'm sorry.

1134
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,360
l was gonna take my commission
and buy Ferris a car.

1135
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:03,240
Jeanie, what the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill us?

1136
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:04,950
God, look at this mess.

1137
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,000
Paper all over the place.
l'll never get this back in order.

1138
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,470
Jeanie!

1139
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:30,020
-Slow down! Now! Now!
-l can't drive when you're yelling at me!

1140
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,190
Stop it!

1141
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:03,760
-Hi, how you doing? Ferris Bueller.
-Hi.

1142
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,600
-No, don't get up.
-Hey.

1143
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:35,190
Smells delicious.

1144
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:37,610
-Dinner's ready.
-What?

1145
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:39,190
Who's that?

1146
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:15,850
-What's wrong?
-Everything.

1147
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:18,860
l just picked up Jeanie
at the police station.

1148
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,150
She got a speeding ticket,
another speeding ticket

1149
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,030
and l lost the Vermont deal
because of her.

1150
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,950
l think we should shoot her.

1151
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,410
Looking for this?

1152
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:49,470
l got you, Ferris.

1153
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:52,100
-How's Ferris? Let's go check on him.
-Okay, honey. Yeah.

1154
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,350
How was your day?

1155
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:58,020
l have dreamed about this.

1156
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:03,230
This time, goddamn, you little bastard,

1157
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:06,400
l've got you right where l want you.

1158
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:08,320
Ferris, we're home.

1159
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:11,570
So,

1160
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:17,040
how would you feel
about another year of high school?

1161
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,290
Under my close personal supervision.

1162
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:25,050
Hi.

1163
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:31,470
Thank God you're all right. You know,
we've been worried sick about you.

1164
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:38,890
Thank you, Mr. Rooney,
for driving him home.

1165
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:43,610
Now l want you to go upstairs
and get in bed.

1166
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:56,040
Scoot!

1167
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,410
Can you imagine
someone as sick as Ferris

1168
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,790
trying to walk home from the hospital?

1169
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:04,750
Oh, kids.

1170
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,890
By the way, Mr. Rooney,
you left your wallet on the kitchen floor.

1171
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,080
Honey.

1172
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:23,750
-He's still awfully warm.
-How do you feel?

1173
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,250
150% better. Thank you.

1174
01:37:30,090 --> 01:37:31,090
Please,

1175
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:34,760
don't make me stay home again.
l wanna go to school.

1176
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:39,760
l have to graduate in June. And l want...

1177
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:41,810
Ferris, you're sick.

1178
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:44,850
Now don't go pushing it
and making yourself worse.

1179
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:48,770
-Maybe you're right, Dad.
-l know l'm right, pal.

1180
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:52,940
How'd you get to be so sweet?

1181
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,610
Years of practice.

1182
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,130
Blanket.

1183
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,640
Get well.

1184
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:21,720
Come on.

1185
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,650
Listen, l'm going to get myself settled
and l'll bring a hot cup of soup, okay?

1186
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:40,330
Yup.

1187
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:43,160
l said it before and l'll say it again.

1188
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,460
Life moves pretty fast.

1189
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:49,580
lf you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it.

1190
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,310
Four years of chasing this kid.

1191
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:07,520
Four years he has been
making a fool of me.

1192
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:21,870
Hey, Mr. Rooney, what's going on?

1193
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:27,040
Did you get in a fight?

1194
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,710
Want a lift?

1195
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:19,320
l bet you never smelled
a real school bus before.

1196
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:34,420
Gummy Bear?

1197
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,250
They've been in my pocket.
They're real warm and soft.

1198
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:28,760
You're still here?

1199
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,810
lt's over.

1200
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:36,020
Go home.

1201
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,530
Go.
