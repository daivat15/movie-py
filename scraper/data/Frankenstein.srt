1
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,950
I busied myself to think of a story...

2
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:38,496
...which would speak
to the mysterious fears of our nature...

3
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:42,959
...and awaken thrilling horror.

4
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:48,464
One to make the reader
dread to look around.

5
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:53,970
To curdle the blood,
and quicken the beatings of the heart.

6
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:51,027
Tell the captain,
we've got to take in the topsail.

7
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,780
She's going to rip!

8
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:02,747
Please, captain!
We have to drop the sails!

9
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,874
All hands to the mast!

10
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,168
Take the wheel! Come on!

11
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,052
Captain, we've hit the ice!
We've hit the ice!

12
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,222
Iceberg ahead!

13
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,562
Hard to starboard!

14
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,194
Go back!

15
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,591
Help! Help!

16
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,929
-Help!
-Hold on, Vernon!

17
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,431
Hold on!

18
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,956
Put your backs into it, men!

19
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,833
Let's go!

20
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,836
Captain, this is useless.
The ice stretches for miles.

21
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,297
What do you suggest we do?
Lay down and die?

22
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,091
The men are exhausted, sir.
They can't go on, man.

23
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,678
I tell you, I have not come this far
to give up now.

24
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,306
They knew the risk
when they signed on.

25
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,809
And we are gonna chop our way
to the North Pole if we have to.

26
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,313
Then you run the risk of mutiny,
captain.

27
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,525
-Did you say mutiny?
-Yes I did, sir.

28
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,824
We proceed north as planned.

29
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,619
At the cost of how many more lives?

30
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,330
As many as it takes!

31
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,512
There's something out there.

32
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,349
What is it?

33
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,522
What the hell is that?

34
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,760
Who is your captain?

35
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,887
I am.

36
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,223
Who the devil are you?

37
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,892
I've no time to talk.

38
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,479
You bring your men and your weapons
and follow me.

39
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,942
-Now!
-Stay where you are.

40
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,194
I give the orders here.

41
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,243
Get the dogs! Get them!

42
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,745
Leave them.

43
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,249
They're already dead.

44
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,596
Get back to the ship now!

45
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,057
Everybody back to the ship!

46
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,104
Bears don't kill like that, nothing does.

47
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,273
Maybe it wants the man
with the captain.

48
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,317
-Or it wants the captain.
-The devil's come for the captain.

49
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:05,156
For the last time, I made my way from
St. Petersburg to Archangel on foot.

50
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:12,038
From there I took a whaling ship north.
When we hit the ice, I used the dogs.

51
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,754
What's out there?

52
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:29,430
Listen to me. I have spent six years
planning this, my entire fortune.

53
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,975
I will not be stopped by you
or some phantom.

54
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,687
Do you share my madness?

55
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,942
-No, not madness.
-What, then?

56
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,699
There's a passage to the North Pole,
and I will find it.

57
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,869
At the cost of your own life?
The lives of your crew?

58
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,622
Lives come and go.

59
00:06:55,207 --> 00:07:00,169
If we succeed,
our names will live on forever.

60
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:05,341
I will be hailed
as the benefactor of our species.

61
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,384
You're wrong.

62
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,680
I, of all men, know that.

63
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,891
Who are you?

64
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,853
My name...

65
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,482
...is Victor...

66
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,528
...Frankenstein.

67
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,211
Mother!

68
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,215
Oh, my wonderful son Victor!

69
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,760
You are the handsomest, kindest,
cleverest...

70
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:54,056
...most wonderfulest boy
in the whole world!

71
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,061
Madam! You will spoil the boy, really.

72
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,531
Would you two leave us, please,
Mrs. Moritz?

73
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,740
Doctor.

74
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,077
Come along, Justine.

75
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:22,459
Victor, this is Elizabeth.
She's coming to live with us.

76
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:28,924
She's lost both her mother and father
to the scarlet fever, Victor.

77
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,926
She's an orphan now.

78
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,053
You must think of her
as your own sister.

79
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,060
You must look after her,
and be kind to her.

80
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,440
Always.

81
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,123
Mother, oh.
How is the imminent arrival?

82
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,001
Oh, a little frisky today.

83
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,680
When you were a little boy,
you used to chase fireflies in the field.

84
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,308
Yes, and when I trapped them
in my jar, they died.

85
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,685
-And do you remember how you cried?
-Yes.

86
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,939
Because you wanted to keep them
glowing by your bedside...

87
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,857
...to light you as you read.

88
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,278
You were so hungry for knowledge.
Such a serious little boy.

89
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,825
You've become
such an earnest young man.

90
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,290
All these strange and ancient books.

91
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,836
You'll be an even greater doctor
than your father.

92
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,261
But you know, Victor,
life shouldn't be all study.

93
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,013
There's such fun to be had.

94
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,350
-Give me that back.
-No.

95
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,143
Give me that back, Mother.

96
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,238
Change partners. And twirl!

97
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,864
-Now, Caroline.
-You're right.

98
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,826
-You mustn't exert yourself. Please.
-I know.

99
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:22,413
Don't worry, madam. Your new baby
will be a natural dancer.

100
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,331
Excellent.

101
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,545
You'll be the envy
of all the young ladies and gentlemen.

102
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,008
Justine.

103
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,677
Justine, may I have this dance?

104
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,393
-Madam!
-Hurry!

105
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,730
You must make a decision!

106
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,190
How can I?
The baby's in the wrong position.

107
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,943
I can't proceed.... I can't....

108
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,906
Cut me. Save the baby.

109
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,250
She'll be all right.

110
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,587
Your father's the finest doctor
in Geneva.

111
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,847
Father?

112
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,351
Father?

113
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,355
Father, how is she?

114
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,818
I did everything I could....
Everything I could....

115
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,280
Mother? Mother!

116
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,595
Bring her back.

117
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,599
Please, bring her back.

118
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,809
No!

119
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,896
Please, bring her back.

120
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,013
Oh, Mother.

121
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:51,186
You should never have died.
No one need ever die.

122
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,356
I will stop this.

123
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,651
I will stop this.

124
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,362
I promise.

125
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,242
Victor, you're completely obsessed.
Please explain what that is.

126
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,245
It's energy. It never disappears,
it merely changes form.

127
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,497
It's possible to convert
this candle wax...

128
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,833
...into the convulsions
of a mechanical dog.

129
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,713
But the applications of this
are limitless. Really.

130
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,425
Oh, please come outside, Victor.
It's such a beautiful day.

131
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,969
Go away, I'm busy.

132
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,850
What's this?

133
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,978
It's for spraying down the electric eels.

134
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,858
Now, put it down. Put it down.
It's not for playing with.

135
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,403
It's not for playing with. Put it down,
put it down-- Don't do that.

136
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,240
I warned you. Don't-- Don't--
Give me that, you little....

137
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,120
Come on!

138
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,210
Come on!

139
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,086
We should be grateful to Victor...

140
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,756
...for abandoning his experiments
for one afternoon.

141
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,425
Well, who says I have?

142
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,260
What do you mean?

143
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,595
Look!

144
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,597
We're all going to die.

145
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,933
-You knew this would happen.
-Not for certain.

146
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,311
But I had hoped the conditions
would be right. They're common here.

147
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,897
I've never seen one quite as large,
though. Look.

148
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,900
-Isn't it wonderful?
-Victor, you shouldn't have done this.

149
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,568
It's all right, it's all right.

150
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,155
-We must take cover. A tree!
-That's exactly the wrong thing to do.

151
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,449
It's a much larger conductor
than we are.

152
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,951
Victor, what about Willie?

153
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,912
-What are we to do?
-Come on.

154
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,831
Spread out.
Elizabeth, take this. Now, quickly.

155
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,168
-Come on, quickly!
-What is that?

156
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,129
Dig it right into the ground. Go ahead.

157
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,465
-Now what?
-Justine, take this. Come on.

158
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,468
-Willie!
-Everyone down.

159
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,682
Give me your hands. It'll be fine.
Now take him. Now, that's good.

160
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,517
I hope you know
what you're doing.

161
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,144
-Willie? Willie, don't look up!
-Willie.

162
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,980
-Victor--
-Wait!

163
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,358
One, two, three....

164
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,828
Now.

165
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,221
So how do you feel, Elizabeth?

166
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,850
Alive.

167
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,635
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends.
Gather round and listen.

168
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,722
As you probably know,
tomorrow my dear son Victor...

169
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,600
...leaves me to pursue,
what I'm sure...

170
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,227
...will be an illustrious career
in a profession...

171
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,438
...I am not altogether
unassociated with.

172
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,233
Oh, modesty.

173
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,239
My one regret is that his mother...

174
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:37,079
...my late wife, is not here...

175
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,377
...to share the pride...

176
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,923
...which our son fills me with tonight.

177
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,679
Yes.

178
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:03,939
She wanted you to have this, Victor.
On your graduation.

179
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,735
And in it she has written:

180
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,616
"This is the journal
of Victor Frankenstein."

181
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,330
The rest of the leaves are blank...

182
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,086
...to be filled with the deeds
of a noble life.

183
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,615
We'd better go in,
before they miss us.

184
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,160
Just a little while longer. Please.

185
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,789
I don't know when we'll be
alone together again.

186
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,460
Oh, dear Victor.

187
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,463
I shall miss you laughing at me.

188
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,675
I'll miss you making me laugh.

189
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,858
So how do brothers and sisters
say goodbye?

190
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
Perhaps they never have to.

191
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,534
I won't, if you won't.

192
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,677
Are you my sister?

193
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,223
Sister...

194
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,725
...friend...

195
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,603
...lover.

196
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,565
Wife?

197
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,567
Yes.

198
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,028
Then come with me to Ingolstadt.
Marry me now.

199
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,405
-Victor, no.
-Well, then I'll stay.

200
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:23,578
I want more than anything else
in the world to be your wife.

201
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,332
But as long as you're away,
I belong here.

202
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,086
I want to make this house live again.

203
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,257
I want to make this
a great home for our children.

204
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:40,637
And now you must go, and do
the great things you need to do.

205
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,890
I want you so much.

206
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,978
I'll be here when you return.

207
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:53,149
Each holiday. Every visit.

208
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,781
Then on our wedding night.

209
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,961
Until our wedding night.

210
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,652
Lots of stairs, I'm afraid.

211
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,864
-How was your journey?
-Good, thanks. I made good progress...

212
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,991
-...over the mountains.
-I am pleased.

213
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,163
-As I said, we've only got attic space.
-It's exactly what I'm looking for.

214
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,665
But Frau Brach,
there will be a great deal...

215
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,460
...of scientific equipment and rigging
to be delivered.

216
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,671
Every day, for the next week.
I trust you have no objections.

217
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,175
I'm sure you appreciate the need
for a proper laboratory.

218
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,177
Oh, Putzi likes you.

219
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,562
This will be perfect.

220
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:20,570
"The foolish and vain
force their views by the rod.

221
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:25,158
But knowledge is power
only through God."

222
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:30,705
Our motto. Easily forgotten
by you young men in a hurry.

223
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:39,881
But perhaps the greatest mistake
that all students make...

224
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,551
...during their time here,
is to suppose...

225
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:48,723
...that they can ever have
an original or creative thought.

226
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:54,854
We have all imagined that
in our time.

227
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:04,739
But gentlemen, you have not come
here in order to think for yourselves.

228
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:09,744
You are here to learn
how to think for your patients.

229
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,706
You must learn, therefore,
in the first place...

230
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,291
...to submit yourselves...

231
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:20,422
...to the established laws
of physical reality.

232
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,881
But surely, professor...

233
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,928
...you don't intend we disregard
more philosophical approaches?

234
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,430
Philosophical?

235
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:34,060
Those which stir the imagination as
well as the intellect, as in Paracelsus.

236
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,523
Paracelsus.
An arrogant and foolish Swiss.

237
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,275
Albertus Magnus?

238
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:45,405
His nonsense was exploded
500 years ago.

239
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,282
Cornelius Agrippa?

240
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,452
A sorcerer. An occultist.
What is your name?

241
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:55,915
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of Geneva.

242
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,085
Another Swiss.

243
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:04,591
Mr. Frankenstein, here at
the University of Ingolstadt, we teach--

244
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,677
And indeed, hope to advance.
--the science of medicine.

245
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:12,265
Chemistry, biology, physics.
We study hard science.

246
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:16,269
Surely, the greatest possible advances
lie in combining these things.

247
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,481
We do not study the ravings
of lunatics and alchemists...

248
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,317
...hundreds of years in their graves...

249
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:28,114
...because their kind of amateur,
fanatical, fantastical speculation...

250
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,201
...does not heal bodies or save lives.

251
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,661
Only science can do that.

252
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:42,087
Now, have we your permission
to continue?

253
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,009
-Nice coat.
-Why, thank you.

254
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,344
Don't take it too hard.

255
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,679
Krempe doesn't approve
of public humiliation.

256
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,641
-I am not mad!
-My dear fellow, of course you're not.

257
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,019
In fact, that's just what I'd expect
a perfectly rational person...

258
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,563
...to say to a complete stranger.

259
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:04,317
Henry Clerval, by the way,
and I'm completely crazy.

260
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,361
-Victor Frankenstein.
-Of Geneva.

261
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,196
-Of Geneva.
-Yes, I noti--

262
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,865
Why don't you look where I'm going?

263
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,036
That's Schiller.
Ornament of the playing field.

264
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,538
-Really.
-He's new as well.

265
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,250
You can tell because he goes around
looking at things with his mouth open.

266
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,711
What are you here for?

267
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,548
-Research.
-Very grand.

268
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,883
I'm here to become a mere doctor.

269
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,344
I'm told it has something to do
with healing the sick.

270
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,848
Which is a pity, really, because
I find sick people rather revolting.

271
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,393
Still, I'll have a good time,
get my degree--

272
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,353
If I can stop failing Anatomy.

273
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,107
--and settle down to relieve rich
old ladies of their imaginary ailments...

274
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,360
...and then relieve their very real
and beautiful daughters.

275
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,905
-Who was that? He was at the lecture.
-That's Waldman.

276
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,407
-That's Waldman.
-Yes.

277
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,909
Interesting case.
They say in his youth...

278
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,745
...he could break into heaven
and lecture God on science.

279
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,248
Ran into trouble with the authorities
years back.

280
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,750
Something to do
with illegal experiments.

281
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,545
But what kind of experiments,
I wonder?

282
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:09,924
So what was it you were saying?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?

283
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:14,262
Yes, it's a life of sacrifice, I know,
but someone's got to do it.

284
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,154
And that is why
the central nervous system...

285
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,489
...and its crowning achievement,
the brain...

286
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,284
...are as complicated and mysterious
a set of organs...

287
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,661
...as you are ever likely to encounter.

288
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,790
Mr. Frankenstein,
the incision is yours.

289
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,964
Excellent.

290
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:54,594
Mr. Clerval,
you may remove the cranial lid.

291
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,935
"Henry, now fully recovered, continues
his struggle to pass Anatomy."

292
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,686
I was always terrible at anatomy.

293
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,315
"Professor Waldman is very tolerant
of us. I'm learning a great deal."

294
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,193
-Professor Waldman is remarkable.
-And so is Henry.

295
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,195
"God bless you, all my love, Victor."

296
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,530
-That's very nice.
-"P.S. I've fallen in love."

297
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,032
I beg your pardon?

298
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,785
"She's dark, sleek, and beautiful...

299
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,663
...and always wags her tail
whenever she sees me.

300
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,501
Her name is Putzi, and she's the
friendliest sheepdog that I've known."

301
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:33,341
"P.S. Elizabeth,
I dream of how your hair shines...."

302
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,552
"Of how your lips taste.
I dream of your arms and breasts...

303
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,346
...and of the time
on our wedding night...

304
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,307
...when we will be alone
together at last."

305
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,892
What else does it say?

306
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,187
It says, "I'm working very hard
to make lots of new friends."

307
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,147
More coffee, anyone?

308
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:57,031
Once and for all, Frankenstein!
Life is life, death is death.

309
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,033
These things are real.

310
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,869
-They are absolute.
-That is rubbish and you know it!

311
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,039
That premise has been repeatedly
challenged by your own staff!

312
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,167
Yes, you, sir! We don't know
where life ends or death begins.

313
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,046
Hair continues to grow after what we
choose to call death. So do fingernails.

314
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,340
We know that a man's brain may die...

315
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,385
...but his heart and lungs may
continue to pump and breathe.

316
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,761
Now, you know that.

317
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,431
Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva,
I warn you...

318
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,102
...what you are suggesting is not only
illegal, it is immoral.

319
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,812
Rubbish!

320
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:35,695
"Dear diary, why does no one
understand me? P.S. I am not mad."

321
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,072
You.

322
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,576
-Explain yourself.
-Professor, I'm sorry.

323
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,412
Listen, I came here to learn
all about the new science.

324
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,622
About galvanism,
Franklin's experiments.

325
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,625
Combination of modern disciplines
with ancient knowledge...

326
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,086
-...to protect and create--
-To create what?

327
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,383
Sir, we can change things. We can
make things better. You know that.

328
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,927
We are on the verge
of undreamed-of discoveries...

329
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:04,932
...if we only have the courage to ask
the right questions. You must help me.

330
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,437
Come on.

331
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,648
-Victor....
-Come on.

332
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,408
Henry.

333
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,091
Lock the door.

334
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,681
Now, for thousands of years...

335
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,976
...the Chinese have based
their medical science on the belief...

336
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:53,314
...that the human body is a chemical
engine run by energy streams.

337
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:57,402
-Fascinating. How do they explain--?
-Don't touch that!

338
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,655
Their doctors treat patients...

339
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,991
...by inserting needles like these
into the flesh...

340
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,495
...at various key points,
to manipulate these electric streams.

341
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,830
I see.

342
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
So electricity is the key.

343
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,169
Now, look at this.

344
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,436
Go on, touch it.

345
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,025
-It feels warm.
-It is.

346
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,196
Yes. How do you do?

347
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,075
Turn it off!

348
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,744
-I can't, it's not working.
-Try to stay calm, Henry.

349
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,164
Simply a matter
of reducing the polarity.

350
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,499
A monkey's arm is basically
the same as ours.

351
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,085
-No arm is this strong!
-Now, this must work.

352
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,345
Let me help you, professor.

353
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,516
You shall, of course, tell no one.

354
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,104
They wouldn't believe you anyway.

355
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:25,364
Dearest Victor.
Nothing much changes here.

356
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:31,078
Mrs. Moritz continues to love and
torment Justine, in equal measure.

357
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,206
Willie grows more precocious
every day...

358
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,374
...and Father almost expires
with pride...

359
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,585
...at the very thought of you
and your work.

360
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,253
And I....

361
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:44,383
Well, I just miss you, very much.

362
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,636
Please write soon, Victor.

363
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,889
No, I'm serious.
You take vaccine, for instance.

364
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,100
Thirty years ago the entire concept
of vaccine was unheard of...

365
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,144
...and now we save lives every day.

366
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,813
-But that isn't the whole answer.
-What do you mean?

367
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,943
That sooner or later the best way
to cheat death will be to create life.

368
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,653
Now you've gone too far.

369
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,739
-There's only one God, Victor.
-No, leave God out of it.

370
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,450
If you loved someone,
they had a sick heart...

371
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,578
...wouldn't you give them a healthy
one? It's not impossible.

372
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,247
We can do it, we're steps away.

373
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,667
If we can replace one part of a
human, we can replace every part.

374
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,752
And if we do that,
we can design a life.

375
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,838
We can create a being
that will not grow old or sicken.

376
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,299
One that's stronger than us,
better than us.

377
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,010
One more intelligent than us,
more civilized than us.

378
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,180
-In our lifetime?
-No.

379
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,979
How close did you get, professor?

380
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,355
Too close.

381
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,027
Professor, I beg you,
let me see these notes.

382
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,822
No. My work now,
and its application...

383
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,951
...lies exclusively
in the preservation of life.

384
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,204
I abandoned my other researches
many years ago.

385
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,455
Why?

386
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,377
Because they resulted in abomination.

387
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,734
You're not sticking that in me.
It's got a pox in it, I hear.

388
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,485
-Pox? They've given us pox?
-Pox.

389
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,864
It's not pox, it's a vaccine
that will prevent plague in this city.

390
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,366
-What's that?
-It's a tiny, harmless amount...

391
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,161
-...of anti-smallpox serum.
-You just said pox!

392
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,829
I said it was harmless.

393
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,249
It's a necessary precaution,
without which this godforsaken city...

394
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,585
...would be immediately
put under quarantine.

395
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,547
You doctors kill. I don't care what
you say. You're not sticking that in me.

396
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,716
Yes, I am. It's the law!

397
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:53,012
-Sit him down, someone.
-You're not sticking that in me!

398
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,139
You're not sticking that in me!

399
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,144
-Sir?
-Professor? Sir?

400
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,898
Find him!

401
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,402
Come on! Come on! Come on!

402
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,696
It's no use, Victor, he's gone.

403
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,406
-No! No, Henry!
-Let him go!

404
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,243
-No! No, this shouldn't happen!
-Let him go! Victor, stop!

405
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,537
-It shouldn't happen!
-Stop!

406
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:23,709
It need not happen!

407
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,218
The hell with you!

408
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:38,808
Whatever you say, whatever you
call it, you doctors are killers.

409
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,938
You murder people!
Evil! You're evil!

410
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,815
Evil!

411
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:52,613
You're the ones that deserve to die.
God will punish you. He'll punish you!

412
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,950
God will punish you!

413
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:14,969
My God, you were so close!
Of course, the power!

414
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:19,807
The materials were wrong.
You needed auxiliary sources.

415
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,769
"The experiment a failure.

416
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:29,817
Resulting reanimant
malformed and hideous to behold.

417
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:34,321
This factor dependant on the
appropriate raw materials."

418
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,953
Raw materials....

419
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,183
-Come on, Henry.
-I can't help you, Victor.

420
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,020
-You won't. What are you afraid of?
-Everything! What if the authorities--?

421
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,816
We'll do this in secret. I've got the raw
materials, I've got Waldman's journals.

422
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,861
-You stole his journals?
-We owe it to him to complete this.

423
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,197
-He was one step away.
-He never wanted this.

424
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,032
Couldn't face it, that's different.

425
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,036
Even if it were possible,
and even if you had the right--

426
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,872
Which you don't.
--to make this decision for us...

427
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,083
...can you imagine there wouldn't
be a terrible price to pay?

428
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,753
I think for the chance
to defeat death and disease...

429
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,547
...to let everyone on Earth
have the chance at life...

430
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,382
...sustained, healthy life...

431
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,596
...to allow people who love each
other to be together forever....

432
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:45,017
For all of that,
I think it's a risk worth taking.

433
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,248
Please, Justine, just leave me alone.
I won't talk about it.

434
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,252
But all these letters,
you read them to us every week.

435
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,589
I wrote them. I wrote the letters.
He hasn't written to me in months.

436
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,799
Elizabeth....

437
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:20,135
Something horrific is happening
to him. I can feel it.

438
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,430
At first I wasn't sure,
but I knew I had to hide it from Father.

439
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,891
Now there are rumors of cholera.

440
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,936
I can look after Father and Willie.
You go to Ingolstadt--

441
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,565
That's not possible. He won't want me.
He's probably found someone else.

442
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,068
If he was mine,
I would have gone already.

443
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,779
But he isn't mine.

444
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:43,617
He's yours, and you must go to him.

445
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,135
Raw materials, that's all they are.

446
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,638
Tissue to be re-used.

447
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,773
The very finest brain.

448
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,538
-But they all died of cholera, sir.
-No matter.

449
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,165
Thank you.

450
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:43,969
The assembled organs must have
the appropriate nutrients and heat...

451
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:49,016
...and crucially, more direct power.

452
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,522
More direct power.

453
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,421
Amniotic fluid is the
chief biogenic element.

454
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,883
The subject is injected with this.
The copper acupuncture needles...

455
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,052
...are inserted at key energy points.

456
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,056
Now, after the removal of current,
the dead toad should retain animation.

457
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:33,352
But independently
of external power sources.

458
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,737
Yes.

459
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,739
That's it.

460
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,618
That's the combination.
That's the combination!

461
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,245
That's it!

462
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,353
Victor? Victor!

463
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,813
Victor, open the door!

464
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,525
-Victor, please!
-What do you want?

465
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,778
There's cholera. It's an epidemic!

466
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,031
The city's been placed
under martial law.

467
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,159
-Are you listening to me, Victor?
-Yes. And?

468
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,495
The militia's arriving
to quarantine the city.

469
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,830
Most of us are getting out
while we still can.

470
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,667
Krempe knows you're here.
What if he tells the authorities?

471
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,128
Goodbye, Henry.

472
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,547
Victor, it's me.

473
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,841
Elizabeth.

474
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,221
Can you hear me?

475
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,349
Victor, I have to see you.

476
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,187
-Go away.
-Please, Victor!

477
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:46,527
I won't leave here until you see me.

478
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,410
Come in the side door.

479
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,206
Alone!

480
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,679
What's happened to you?

481
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,725
How can you live here like this?

482
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,228
And that stench.

483
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,397
Don't go in there!

484
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,530
-We have to leave. It isn't safe.
-No, I have to stay.

485
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,951
-Even if it means you'll die?
-Yes.

486
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,548
Well, let me help you.

487
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,594
No, that's impossible.

488
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,807
We made a promise.

489
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,233
Victor, I beg you.

490
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:16,491
Look, I know that this
is difficult for you to understand...

491
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:21,622
...but I cannot abandon this work
now.

492
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:28,253
It is too important. Not just for me,
but, believe me, for everyone.

493
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:36,220
And it must come first.

494
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,267
Before us?

495
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,107
Elizabeth...

496
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,820
...I love you so much, but....

497
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,251
Goodbye.

498
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,777
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

499
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,491
Oh, God! Elizabeth!

500
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,368
Elizabeth!

501
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,949
Live! Live! Live!

502
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,700
Live!

503
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,496
Yes!

504
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,932
No....

505
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,184
No!

506
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,688
No!

507
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,400
No!

508
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,652
No!

509
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,712
It's alive.

510
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,257
It's alive.

511
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:30,865
No.

512
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,515
What have I done?

513
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,149
What have I done?

514
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:19,831
"Massive birth defects.

515
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:25,879
Greatly enhanced
physical strength.

516
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:31,551
But resulting reanimant...

517
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:36,222
...is malfunctional...

518
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,558
...and pitiful...

519
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:43,855
...and dead."

520
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:52,656
Tomorrow this journal and
its secrets must be destroyed...

521
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,575
...forever.

522
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,465
Oh, God.

523
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,349
No!

524
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:05,979
You fool,
Victor Frankenstein of Geneva.

525
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,106
How could you know
what you'd unleashed?

526
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:15,363
How is it pieced together?
Bits of thieves, bits of murderers....

527
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:19,159
Evil stitched to evil stitched to evil.

528
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:24,664
Do you really believe this thing
will thank you for its monstrous birth?

529
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,791
Evil will have its revenge.

530
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:32,839
God help your loved ones.

531
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,708
What do you think you're doing?

532
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,630
He's got cholera! He's the one
who's been spreading the plague!

533
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,590
Get him!

534
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,129
Come here, you--

535
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,431
Keep away from him.

536
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,474
No, kill him now!

537
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,701
He went this way.

538
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:59,754
There now. Easy. Easy. Just a bit.

539
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:06,761
-That's it. There, now, rest easy.
-Henry, you're here.

540
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:11,891
Of course I'm here.
It was touch and go with you, though.

541
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:15,603
I feared cholera,
turned out to be pneumonia.

542
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,856
Yes, I'm becoming
something of a doctor.

543
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,567
Even Krempe
seems pleased with me.

544
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,988
At this rate,
I might even pass Anatomy.

545
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:29,075
-The epidemic?
-Dreadful.

546
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,411
There's nothing we can do for them.

547
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:35,289
The vulnerable, anyone who's
without shelter or food...

548
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,917
...the newborns, especially, will die.

549
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,254
-Are you sure?
-I'm certain of it.

550
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,757
Thank God.

551
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,094
What do you mean?

552
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,103
Nothing.

553
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:05,069
Well then, that's my shift finished.

554
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,949
I'll see you later.

555
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,294
Elizabeth.

556
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,478
Elizabeth.

557
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,034
-Please, please, forgive me!
-Of course I do.

558
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,584
Victor, I don't know what you're
working on, and I don't want to know.

559
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,379
But it nearly killed you.

560
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:51,551
It's over, it's finished.
It should never have started.

561
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:55,054
It's dead! It's dead.

562
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,777
-Felix!
-Yes?

563
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,447
Don't forget the onion scraps.

564
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:59,076
All right, I've got them.

565
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,412
Go on, get.

566
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,957
Come on. Come on.

567
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,586
Go on, go on. Go on. Get.

568
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,978
-How are the pigs?
-Happy they've been fed.

569
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,358
-How are your hands?
-They're bleeding again.

570
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,318
Let me see them.

571
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,118
That's better.

572
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,833
There.

573
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,171
-The soup's ready.
-Come on, Grandpa. Sit down.

574
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,590
Thank you.

575
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,320
We'll never get through the winter
with this yield.

576
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:02,575
-The ground's frozen hard.
-We'll sell another pig at market.

577
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:07,413
We can't.
Not until they lift the quarantine.

578
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:11,584
Even then, it's one less for us. Last
month's rent, he'll be back for that.

579
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:16,088
Come on. We'll do this together.

580
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,885
You're right.

581
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:24,597
We've got to,
before the snow comes.

582
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:33,731
Come on, then.

583
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:57,755
The ground's frozen solid. We'd need
20 men to do this. It's useless!

584
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,759
-It's getting late.
-We don't have enough to eat.

585
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,137
We'll manage. Let's go.

586
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,955
Look. Look.

587
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:45,678
They must be gifts
from the Good Spirit of the Forest.

588
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:49,140
Father, nothing in this life
comes free of cost.

589
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:55,020
-I would like to know who and why.
-Was it the Good Spirit, Grandpa?

590
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,733
-I believe it was.
-Don't fill their head with nonsense.

591
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,547
Who's there?

592
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,885
Felix? Children?

593
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,065
Right.

594
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,402
What's this one?

595
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:52,912
-Friend?
-Friend! Well done!

596
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,581
That's very good.

597
01:03:55,749 --> 01:04:01,212
You've got lots of friends,
haven't you? Grandpa and....

598
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:07,426
Friend....

599
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:16,060
Friend....

600
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,659
Friend.

601
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,041
Friend.

602
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,629
Family.

603
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,801
Father.

604
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,972
You must travel with them
for the entire journey.

605
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,140
This equipment
must not be left unattended.

606
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,143
My father will take delivery of them
in Geneva. Understand?

607
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,353
I do, sir.

608
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,980
-Going somewhere?
-Henry, look.

609
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,983
Look at this locket Victor gave me.
Isn’t it beautiful?

610
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,987
-Yes, it's lovely. Is this really you?
-Yes, it's a bad likeness, I know.

611
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,323
But for now,
it will serve instead of a ring.

612
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,660
Congratulations
on the entirely expected!

613
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,663
-When?
-As soon as we get home.

614
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,166
We'll be there for New Year's Eve.

615
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,003
-He's taking over Father's practice.
-And expanding it.

616
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,172
I'm going on ahead now the
quarantine's lifted. So much to do.

617
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,467
Now, the practice needs a partner.
Now, there's not much money...

618
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:34,346
...but there is food and board
and some very good company.

619
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:39,852
And it's the ideal position for someone
who has finally passed Anatomy.

620
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,479
So we were wondering if...

621
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,524
...there was anybody
that you could recommend?

622
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:50,070
Victor, I-- I don't know what to say.

623
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,489
Well, please say yes.

624
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,700
-Yes.
-Yes!

625
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,662
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!

626
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:02,625
And you can write that down
in your journal!

627
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,559
"This is...

628
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:24,938
...the journal...

629
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,774
...of...

630
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:30,694
...Victor...

631
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,407
...Frankenstein...

632
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,909
...of...

633
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,537
...Geneva."

634
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,959
Come on, quickly.

635
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,587
Come on, then, off you go.
Quickly, now.

636
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,258
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

637
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,594
Come on, now. Come on.
Time for bed.

638
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,304
In you go.

639
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:13,487
"For the Good Spirit of the Forest."

640
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,004
Are you
the Good Spirit of the Forest?

641
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,466
Not exactly. Where's your father?

642
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:38,137
I said, where's your father?

643
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,471
Who's there? Maggie?

644
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,308
-No.
-Oh, it's you.

645
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,769
-What have you done to Maggie?
-Is he in there?

646
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,855
Hiding behind a blind old man?

647
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,940
Get away! Get away!

648
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,987
Don't blame me.

649
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:58,490
Blame your son
for not paying his rent on time.

650
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,755
My God.

651
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:18,051
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you so much.

652
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,473
Won't you come and sit by the fire?

653
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,394
Please, don't be afraid.

654
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:32,191
Come. Come in.

655
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:43,202
Have a rest, sit down.

656
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,707
That's better.

657
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:53,295
I'm glad you finally came in.

658
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,382
A man shouldn't have to hide
in the shadows.

659
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:08,393
Better that way, for me.

660
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,522
Why?

661
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:16,318
People are afraid.

662
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,905
Except you.

663
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,076
It can't be as bad as that.

664
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,332
Worse.

665
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:39,424
I can "see" you with my hands,
if you'll trust me.

666
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,155
-Papa, Papa, he hurt Grandpa!
-Who hurt Grandpa?

667
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,783
-What was that noise?
-Tell me what the noise was.

668
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,285
What happened, Maggie?

669
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,287
Poor man.

670
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,879
Have you no friends?

671
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:25,679
There are some people.

672
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,937
But they don't know me.

673
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:36,982
Why do you not go to them?

674
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:47,534
Because I am so very...

675
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,125
...ugly.

676
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:03,175
And they are so very...

677
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,349
...beautiful.

678
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,018
Father! Get out of here!

679
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:18,982
-Get out of here, monster.
-Leave him alone!

680
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,863
We have to leave here.

681
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,747
No.

682
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:05,130
I will have revenge!

683
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,094
Frankenstein!

684
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,505
Geneva.

685
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,313
-Quickly, quickly.
-She's here, she's here!

686
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,816
-Willie!
-We got your letter!

687
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,901
It's the first one
I was allowed to read.

688
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,195
Congratulations, Elizabeth.

689
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,031
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you, Justine.

690
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,866
Oh, is that the locket?

691
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,370
Look how handsome Victor is.

692
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:21,915
-Can I take this to show Peter?
-Yes, but, Willie, it's not a toy.

693
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,917
Let him go.
Don't dawdle, William!

694
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,554
Justine, you idiot. Pay attention.

695
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,431
Anyone would think
you're the one that's getting married.

696
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,933
-Yes, Mother.
-What's wrong?

697
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,935
Nothing. Really.

698
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:44,938
Just leave it. You've ruined it now.

699
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:16,595
No! No!

700
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:31,276
Frankenstein.

701
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,446
You, with me.

702
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,615
-Have you seen Willie?
-Isn’t he back yet?

703
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,075
Claude went
to find if he'd lost track of time.

704
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:43,288
-They say he never arrived.
-Far too late for him to still be out.

705
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,129
-William!
-William!

706
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,298
-William!
-William!

707
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,926
Willie!

708
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,471
Willie!

709
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,438
Willie....

710
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:10,774
Willie!

711
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,818
This isn't a game!

712
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,325
Willie!

713
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:24,162
It's so late.

714
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:31,544
We're all so tired. I'm so tired.

715
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,968
Father! I'm so pleased to see you.

716
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,058
What's wrong?

717
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,163
William!

718
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,092
We checked the east ridge.
There's nothing there.

719
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,719
Damn!

720
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,224
Elizabeth?

721
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,602
I found him!

722
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:33,064
I found him!

723
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,610
Elizabeth!

724
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,406
No!

725
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:17,400
We did everything we could, sir.

726
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:23,365
You just rest easy now.
We did everything we could.

727
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:29,120
Sir, I'm terrified for my girl.
She's still out looking for William.

728
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:34,959
We parted badly. I was cruel to her.
I didn't mean it.

729
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:41,800
I think she finds it hard, with your
wedding. She loves you dearly.

730
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,302
I couldn't bear it if anything
happened to her.

731
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,472
She's all I've got. Please, help me!

732
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,393
We'll organize another search
now that it's light.

733
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,604
We will find her, Mrs. Moritz,
I promise.

734
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,528
-How is Father?
-His heart is breaking.

735
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,498
Mr. Frankenstein...

736
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:18,795
...we've apprehended the murderer,
five miles from here hiding in a barn.

737
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:23,633
We found this on her.
It's yours, I believe, sir?

738
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,348
Sir, you must come immediately.

739
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,017
The townspeople have gone mad.

740
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:38,231
-What are they doing?
-They must have broken into the jail!

741
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,191
For God's sake, can't you stop them?

742
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,360
They've gone wild!
This is a lynching mob!

743
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,655
Stop! This is unlawful.

744
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,532
-Justine.
-Justine!

745
01:19:55,875 --> 01:20:00,378
Victor! Help me!
I was trying to find him!

746
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:03,882
I went to the lake, but it was dark!

747
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,718
I wanted to bring him to you!

748
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:13,391
He must be there for the wedding!
I'm sorry! He's so tiny.

749
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,429
We managed to close the gates
on the mob, Claude.

750
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,765
What about Justine?

751
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,559
We've cut her down.
We can bury her in the morning.

752
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:59,437
Thank you, Claude. Get to bed.

753
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,530
The sea of ice.

754
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,033
I will meet you there...

755
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:15,411
...on the sea of ice.

756
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,683
Oh, Justine, forgive me.

757
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:42,146
Victor, tell me. Who is this man?
How do you know he's responsible?

758
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,482
I'll tell you everything
after I destroy him.

759
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,317
This is a matter for the police.

760
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,486
They wouldn't understand.

761
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,572
Well, neither do I.

762
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,992
Then just accept it.

763
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,726
Get up.

764
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:45,561
Get up.

765
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,772
You do speak.

766
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,817
Yes, I speak.

767
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,111
And read.

768
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:57,115
And think.

769
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,243
And know the ways of man.

770
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,829
How did you find me?

771
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,085
Your journal.

772
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,799
Then you mean to kill me.

773
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:17,969
No.

774
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,975
You murdered my brother,
didn't you?

775
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:30,815
I took him by the throat
with one hand...

776
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:34,652
...lifted him off the ground...

777
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:39,323
...and slowly crushed his neck.

778
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:46,330
And as I killed him,
I saw your face.

779
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:56,632
You gave me these emotions. But
you didn't tell me how to use them.

780
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,678
Now two people are dead...

781
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,514
...because of us.

782
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,518
Why?

783
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:15,276
There's something at work in my soul
which I do not understand.

784
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:20,072
What of my soul? Do I have one?

785
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:25,703
Or was that a part you left out?

786
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:31,042
Who were these people
of which I am comprised?

787
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,838
Good people? Bad people?

788
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:40,218
-Materials, nothing more.
-You're wrong.

789
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,224
Do you know
I knew how to play this?

790
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:51,729
In which part of me
did this knowledge reside?

791
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,357
In these hands?

792
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,693
In this mind? In this heart?

793
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:03,825
And reading and speaking.

794
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:11,415
Not things learned,
so much as things remembered.

795
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:15,753
Trace memories in the brain,
perhaps.

796
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:22,218
Did you ever consider
the consequences of your actions?

797
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:31,143
You gave me life,
and then you left me to die.

798
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,776
Who am I?

799
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,778
You....

800
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,286
I don't know.

801
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:55,084
And you think I'm evil.

802
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,422
What can I do?

803
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:04,802
There is something I want. A friend.

804
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,804
A friend?

805
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,931
Companion.

806
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:11,475
A female.

807
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:15,021
Someone like me.

808
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:18,190
So she won't hate me.

809
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,526
Like you?

810
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:25,156
Oh, God,
you don't know what you're asking.

811
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:29,535
I do know that...

812
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:34,498
...for the sympathy
of one living being...

813
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:38,419
...I would make peace with all.

814
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,675
I have love in me
the likes of which...

815
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:48,930
...you can scarcely imagine.

816
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:56,854
And rage, the likes of which
you would not believe.

817
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:03,152
If I cannot satisfy the one...

818
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:10,201
...I will indulge the other.

819
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:19,377
And if I consent, how will you live?

820
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:26,050
We would travel north,
my bride and I...

821
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:30,096
...to the furthest reaches of the Pole.

822
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:33,891
Where no man has ever set foot.

823
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:38,854
There, we would live out our lives...

824
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,983
...together.

825
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:47,989
No human eye
would ever see us again.

826
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,284
This, I vow.

827
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:59,000
You must help me. Please.

828
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:06,757
If it is possible
to right this wrong...

829
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:11,262
...then I will do it.

830
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,433
-Victor!
-Victor.

831
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,268
Are you all right?

832
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:23,441
-Yes, I'm safe. I'm safe.
-What happened?

833
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,735
Tell us.

834
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,238
Victor.

835
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,910
Victor, you have to
tell us what happened!

836
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,662
One month, that's all I ask.

837
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:40,166
And then we can be married
and we can forget this whole business.

838
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,294
-I promise.
-Promise? Promise.

839
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,129
Oh, don't dare use that word to me.

840
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:49,008
You promised to tell me who this man
was. You promised to stop this work.

841
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:51,093
-Your promises mean nothing.
-Elizabeth.

842
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,512
-I have to leave this house.
-Where will you go?

843
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,015
-Somewhere I can recover.
-This is ridiculous.

844
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:57,641
I haven't got time to argue.

845
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:01,604
Oh, isn't it convenient?
Or doesn't it fit in with your plans?

846
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:04,815
Don't you ever think
of anyone or anything but yourself?

847
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,662
God forgive me.

848
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,082
Why her?

849
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,879
Materials, remember? Nothing more.

850
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,423
-Your words.
-No.

851
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,635
You will honor your promise to me!

852
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,679
I will not.

853
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:00,931
Go on, kill me now.

854
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,392
That is mild
compared to what will come.

855
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,771
If you deny me my wedding night,
I will be with you on yours.

856
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,066
Elizabeth!

857
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,111
Elizabeth.

858
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:18,407
Wait. Wait, please wait. Please.

859
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:21,952
I have to speak to you. Please!

860
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,464
What do you want to say?

861
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:37,009
Don't go.

862
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:44,308
Please, don't go.

863
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:51,857
I'm frightened.

864
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,488
Of what?

865
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:07,456
I have done something
so terrible...

866
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,962
...so evil.

867
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:20,511
And I'm frightened
that if I tell you the truth...

868
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:24,181
...that I will lose you.

869
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,770
You'll lose me if you don't.

870
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,900
I...

871
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,697
...don't know...

872
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,701
...what...

873
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:47,329
...to do.

874
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:25,868
Will you marry me, Victor?

875
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,124
Marry me today.

876
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:38,088
Tomorrow, tell me everything.

877
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,135
But you must tell me the truth.

878
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:49,433
And together, we can face anything.

879
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:57,149
Whatever you've done,
whatever has happened...

880
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,486
...I love you.

881
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:17,002
To share the truth, the whole truth,
for good or ill...

882
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:23,675
...to stand by each other
in sickness and in health...

883
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:29,264
...and in joy,
from this day forward...

884
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:33,977
...till death do you part.

885
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,121
Who is this man, sir?

886
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,790
-How shall we know him?
-Believe me, you'll know him.

887
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:58,335
He killed Master William,
and Justine Moritz died for it.

888
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,296
No hesitation, lads.
Shoot the bastard on sight!

889
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,965
Henry?

890
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:04,508
Don't worry about a thing.

891
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:07,636
You two look after each other.
I'll look after your father.

892
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:56,059
I'm sorry, sir. The last ferry's gone.
There's nothing now till morning.

893
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:59,354
-Damn.
-I'll secure you lodgings for the night.

894
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,023
-Thank you, Claude.
-Come on.

895
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:07,362
-Keep your pistols dry!
-They're dry enough.

896
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,032
And if they fail, we've others.
And if those fail...

897
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,783
...we can always gut the bastard.

898
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:14,369
-Go to your post.
-Yes, sir.

899
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:20,417
Don't worry, sir.
You're well guarded.

900
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,087
Now, why don't you
go on upstairs to your wife?

901
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:27,216
It's not often
a man has his wedding night.

902
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:53,951
You're soaking.

903
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,630
Brother and sister no more.

904
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:10,801
Now husband and wife.

905
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:37,888
Victor?

906
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,142
Lock the door.

907
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:45,896
-Lock the door.
-Victor.

908
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:48,690
I saw him in a flash of lightning.
He ran to the lake.

909
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:49,941
You two stay here.

910
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,455
We lost him.

911
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,375
Elizabeth!

912
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:09,711
Don't bother to scream.

913
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:33,568
Please.... Please don't hurt me.

914
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:39,616
You are lovelier than
I ever could have imagined.

915
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,285
Elizabeth!

916
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:45,288
Elizabeth!

917
01:40:53,923 --> 01:40:55,632
I keep my promises!

918
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:27,664
For God's sake,
tell me what happened.

919
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:31,042
No point. I know what I have to do.

920
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:33,795
God. No, Victor! You can't do this,
I won't let you!

921
01:41:33,963 --> 01:41:36,214
She's gone. I love her.
What would you do?

922
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:37,507
Leave her in peace.

923
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:40,177
My father would have done this
for my mother.

924
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,304
Your father's dead.

925
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:45,807
Then there's nothing left to lose.

926
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:48,351
Nothing but your soul.

927
01:43:58,441 --> 01:44:01,985
Live!

928
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,822
No!

929
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:37,020
Live. Live.

930
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:42,651
Yes. Yes. Yes.

931
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:12,180
Say my name.

932
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:19,020
Please, say my name.

933
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:25,610
Remember! You must remember.

934
01:45:26,612 --> 01:45:28,196
Elizabeth?

935
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:31,700
Elizabeth?

936
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:40,250
That's it.

937
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:45,422
That's it, you remember.

938
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,802
That's it.

939
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:59,644
Now, stand. Stand.

940
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:15,285
Yes. Yes. Yes.

941
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,060
You remember.

942
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,190
You remember.

943
01:47:31,362 --> 01:47:33,363
She's beautiful.

944
01:47:36,826 --> 01:47:37,909
She's not for you.

945
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:39,994
Come.

946
01:47:43,415 --> 01:47:45,041
Elizabeth?

947
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:48,545
Say my name.

948
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:54,509
Elizabeth.

949
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,264
Yes.

950
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:03,393
Elizabeth!

951
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,232
You're beautiful.

952
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:16,072
Say my name.

953
01:48:16,574 --> 01:48:20,243
Elizabeth, come to me.

954
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:22,912
Come to me.

955
01:49:29,855 --> 01:49:32,315
Say my name, Elizabeth.

956
01:49:33,943 --> 01:49:35,485
Vic....

957
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:38,655
That's right, Elizabeth.

958
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,783
Victor.

959
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:43,826
No, you're mine.

960
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:48,498
You're mine.

961
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:52,502
-Leave her alone! No!
-Get away from her. She's mine.

962
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,171
She's mine! She said my name!
She remembers!

963
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:56,798
She's mine!

964
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,693
No!

965
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:55,273
All that I once loved
lies in a shallow grave...

966
01:50:55,441 --> 01:50:58,026
...by my hand.

967
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:04,866
I followed the trail he left for me--

968
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,452
North.

969
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:10,413
Always north.

970
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:13,374
--for months now...

971
01:51:14,752 --> 01:51:16,753
...with one intent:

972
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:20,465
To kill him.

973
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:25,345
Now...

974
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:32,268
...I'm tired.

975
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:43,112
I'm so very, very tired.

976
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:00,797
What did he say?

977
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:04,133
He's dead.

978
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:11,849
He died raving
about some phantom.

979
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:14,310
What is it out there, captain?

980
01:52:18,482 --> 01:52:22,318
He told me a story that...

981
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:27,031
...couldn't be true.

982
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:33,996
He was mad, I think.

983
01:52:37,334 --> 01:52:39,961
A warming breeze.

984
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:47,677
-The ice will melt yet.
-And what then, captain?

985
01:52:54,017 --> 01:52:56,436
-We head north.
-No.

986
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:22,462
Who are you?

987
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:29,093
He never gave me a name.

988
01:53:56,914 --> 01:53:58,581
Why do you weep?

989
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:04,253
He was my father.

990
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:09,884
"And yea, I gave my heart
to know wisdom...

991
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:12,929
...and to know madness and folly...

992
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:19,602
...and I perceived that all is
vanity and vexation of spirit.

993
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:23,940
For in much wisdom is much grief...

994
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:29,111
...and he that increaseth knowledge,
increaseth sorrow.

995
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:36,285
For God shall bring every work and
every secret thing into judgment...

996
01:54:36,453 --> 01:54:41,165
...whether it be good,
or whether it be evil."

997
01:54:49,466 --> 01:54:53,469
-Captain--
-He has a right to bear witness.

998
01:55:04,648 --> 01:55:06,107
Jesus, it's breaking up!

999
01:55:17,494 --> 01:55:19,620
Get back to the ship, captain.

1000
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:23,124
Leave the damn torch! Leave it!

1001
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:27,336
Come with us.

1002
01:55:29,381 --> 01:55:31,841
I am done with man.

1003
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:44,729
Hang on, I've got you!

1004
01:55:44,896 --> 01:55:47,315
Help! Help!

1005
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:55,197
Here, captain. Here, captain.
Quick, grab my hand!

1006
01:57:06,228 --> 01:57:09,313
Where to now, captain?

1007
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:22,618
Home.
