We're going with you
as far as the noon station at Dry Fork.

164
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,571
There'll be a troop of cavalry there,
and they'll take you on to Apache Wells.

165
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,574
From Apache Wells, you'll have
another escort of soldiers into Lordsburg.

166
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,577
But you must warn your passengers
that they travel at their own risk.

167
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,414
- At their own risk?
What's the trouble, Lieutenant?
- Geronimo.

168
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,958
- Geronimo? Well, then I ain't go -
- Will you sit down!

169
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,460
Of course, the army has no authority
over you gentlemen.

170
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,964
- If you think it's unsafe to make the trip -
- This stage is goin' to Lordsburg.

171
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,007
If you think it ain't safe
to ride along with us...

172
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,136
I figure we can get there
without you soldier boys.

173
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,139
I have my orders, sir,
and I always obey orders.

174
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,890
[Buck Whimpers]

175
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,520
Did you all hear
what the lieutenant said?

176
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,605
Yes, we heard.

177
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,859
Well, me and Buck are taking
this coach through, passengers or not.

178
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,944
Whoever wants to get out can get out.

179
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,656
- It's -
- Courage. Courage, Reverend.

180
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,741
- Ladies first.
- Oh. Excuse me.

181
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,160
How about you, Dallas?

182
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,621
What are you tryin' to do,
scare somebody?

183
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,624
They got me in here.
Now let 'em try to put me out.

184
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,419
There are worse things than Apaches.

185
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,089
If you'll take my advice, ma'am,
you won't take this trip.

186
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:23,886
My husband is with his troops in Dry Fork.
If he's in danger, I want to be with him.

187
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,473
[Clears Throat] You see, brother,
I have a wife and five children in Kansas City.

188
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,643
Then you're a man. By all the powers
that be, Reverend, you're a man.

189
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,940
- All right, folks.
- [Hatfield] Marshal!

190
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,026
Make room for one more.

191
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,572
I'm offering my protection to this lady.

192
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,408
I can shoot fairly straight,
if there's need for it.

193
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,162
That's been proved too many times, Hatfield.
All right, get in. We're late.

194
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,668
- May I trouble you to move over, sir?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

195
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,880
[Curley]
Close the door.

196
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,799
- Aw, Curley, we shouldn't -
- Get going, Buck!

197
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,593
Bessie! Brownie! Bill!

198
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,845
- [Doc] Farewell, ladies!
- [Screams]

199
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,556
- [Buck] Sweetheart! Come on now, girl!
- Good-bye!

200
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,539
[Buck]
Whoa!

201
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,250
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

202
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,752
- Room for another passenger?
- Sure is, Mr. Gatewood.

203
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,380
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- That's right. Just got a telegram.

204
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,967
Had to stop to pack this bag.
Oh, I got it in.

205
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,428
[Buck]
Hyah, hyah! Sassy! Blackie! Brownie! Bill!

206
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,055
Yow!

207
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,338
All right, Brownie.
Queenie, steady, girl.

208
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,466
Good boy. Get along.

209
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:31,763
If there's anything I don't like,
it's drivin' a stagecoach through Apache country.

210
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,683
Funny catching Gatewood
outside of town that way.

211
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,061
I just took this job 10 years ago
so I could make enough money...

212
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,982
to marry my Mexican girl, Julietta,
and I been workin' hard at it ever since.

213
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,151
Bonnie, get over there! Ho!

214
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,486
- Marriage?
- Well, certainly.

215
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,656
My wife's got more relatives
than anyone you ever did see.

216
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,200
I bet I'm feedin'
half the state of Chihuahua.

217
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,827
Sweetheart! Ho!

218
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,371
That seem funny to you about Gatewood?

219
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,374
Yeah, and then what do I get to eat
when I get home in Lordsburg?

220
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,212
Nothin' but frijole beans. That's all.
Nothin' but beans, beans, beans.

221
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,091
Bessie! Brownie! Blackie girl!
Yow! Get along!

222
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,094
Excuse me, ladies.
[Chuckling]

223
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,681
Close quarters.
[Sighs] Warm today.

224
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,851
Your wife made it warm for me, Gatewood.

225
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,021
She was chairman
of our farewell committee.

226
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,690
[Clears Throat]

227
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,109
Fine-looking bunch
of soldier boys back there.

228
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,612
Always gives me great pride
in my country...

229
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,449
when I see such fine young men
in the U.S. Army.

230
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,618
Anybody know where they're going?

231
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,038
Brother, aren't you aware of what's happened?

232
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,957
Happened?
I - I don't follow you, Reverend.

233
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,794
I'm not a clergyman. I'm a -

234
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,505
My friend's a whiskey drummer.

235
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,715
We're all gonna be scalped, Gatewood.

236
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,385
Massacred in one fell swoop.

237
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,554
- That's why the soldiers are with us.
- He's joking, of course.

238
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,308
Oh, no, he's not.
Oh, dear, no. I wish he were.

239
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,688
It's that old Apache butcher, Geronimo.

240
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,691
Geronimo - nice name for a butcher.

241
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,986
He's jumped the reservation.
He's on the warpath.

242
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,865
Geronimo? Why weren't the passengers notified?
Why wasn't I told?

243
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,575
- We -
- We were told, Gatewood.

244
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,952
Yes.

245
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,455
Weren't you told when you got
that message from Lordsburg?

246
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,875
[Clears Throat]
Oh, yes, yes. Y-Yes, of course. I - I forgot.

247
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,560
Steady now! String out! Sweetheart!

248
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,230
Now, doggone it,
they're bringing up her grandfather...

249
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,983
all the way from Mexico
to live with us.

250
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,820
I can't figure out
how he got that message.

251
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,822
- Who? Her grandfather?
- No, Gatewood.

252
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,532
Sweetheart!

253
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,285
- Said he got a message.
- Sweetheart!

254
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,580
- Telegraph line ain't workin'.
- Sweetheart.

255
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,448
[Gunshot]

256
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,078
[Horses Whinnying]

257
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,372
Hold it!

258
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,667
[Buck]
Whoa! Steady! Ho. Ho.

259
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,420
- Hey, look, it's Ringo.
- Yeah.

260
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,174
Hello, Kid.

261
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,176
Hello, Curley.

262
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,095
Hiya, Buck! How's your folks?

263
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,764
Oh, just fine, Ringo.

264
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,099
- Except my grandfather came up -
- Shut up.

265
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,978
Didn't expect to see you ridin' shotgun
on this run, Marshal.

266
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,982
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- I figured you'd be there by this time.

267
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,693
No. Lame horse.

268
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,863
Well, it looks like
you've got another passenger.

269
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,826
Yeah. I'll take the Winchester.

270
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,287
You may need me
and this Winchester, Curley.

271
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,207
Saw a ranch house burnin' last night.

272
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,294
You don't understand, Kid.
You're under arrest.

273
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,798
- Curley -
- [Horse Whinnies]

274
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,018
- Everything all right, Marshal?
- Everything's all right, Lieutenant.

275
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:51,106
- Hope I ain't crowdin' you folks none.
- The more, the merrier.

276
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,902
Bonnie! Brownie! Blackie! Hyah!

277
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,378
Hyah, Bessie!

278
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
Ain't Ringo a fine boy?

279
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,258
I think so.

280
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,848
You're just smarter than a trade rat.
You knew all the time he was goin' to Lordsburg.

281
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,270
Hey, reckon what he meant
he saw ranch houses burnin'?

282
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,439
- Apaches.
- Oh, Apaches.

283
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,025
So, you're the notorious Ringo Kid.

284
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,111
My friends just call me Ringo.

285
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,572
Nickname I had as a kid.

286
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,449
Right name's Henry.

287
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,620
[Doc]
Seems to me I knew your family, Henry.

288
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:51,082
Didn't I fix your arm once
when you were, oh - bucked off a horse?

289
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,460
- Are you Doc Boone?
- I certainly am.

290
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,296
Now, let's see.

291
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,299
I'd just been honorably discharged
from the Union army...

292
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,301
after the War of the Rebellion.

293
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,304
You mean
the War for the Southern Confederacy, sir.

294
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,890
I mean nothing of the kind, sir.

295
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,310
That was my kid brother broke his arm.

296
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,313
You did a good job, Doc,
even if you was drunk.

297
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,315
Thank you, son.

298
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,318
- Professional compliments are always pleasing.
- Yes, they are.

299
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,321
What happened to that boy
whose arm I fixed?

300
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,616
He was murdered.

301
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,121
Put out that cigar.

302
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,375
You're annoying this lady.

303
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,045
Excuse me, madam.

304
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,591
Being so partial to the weed myself...

305
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,137
I sometimes forget
that it disagrees with others.

306
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,642
A gentleman doesn't smoke
in the presence of a lady.

307
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,731
Three weeks ago, I took a bullet out of a man
who was shot by a gentleman.

308
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,733
The bullet was in his back.

309
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,902
- Do you mean to insinuate -
- Sit down, mister.

310
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,408
Doc don't mean no harm.

311
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,584
- Hiya, Pete! Hi, Joey!
- Hello!

312
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,508
[Buck]
Be careful of old Bessie up there now.

313
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,678
Take it easy.
Hold it steady, girl.

314
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,472
[Soldier]
Prepare to dismount!

315
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:57,102
[Buck] Take a look and see if there isn't
a stone bruisin' that hock down there.

316
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:01,022
If it isn't my old friend,
Sergeant Billy Pickett!

317
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:05,735
- Well! How are ya, Billy?
- He's fine, Doc, and mighty glad to see ya!

318
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,738
Great heavens to Betsy! Didn't figure
on no stagecoach comin' through...

319
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,740
with them Apaches raisin' Cain.

320
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,743
I was just telling Billy to hitch up the buckboard
so we could get the young ones in -

321
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,995
Wait a minute! You mean to say
there are no troops at this station?

322
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,373
[Mrs. Pickett]
Ain't no soldiers here but what you see.

323
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,501
But my husband, Captain Mallory -
I was told he was here.

324
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:26,089
He was, dearie. Got orders night afore last
to join the soldiers at Apache Wells.

325
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,176
- [Buck] That means we gotta go back.
- [Gatewood] I can't go back!

326
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:34,347
Driver, you started this coach for Lordsburg,
and it's your duty to get us there.

327
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,808
And it's your duty, young man,
to come along with us!

328
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,811
It's my duty, Mr. Gatewood, to obey orders.
I'm sorry, sir.

329
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,023
Well, if the soldiers go back, Lieutenant,
that means we all have to go back?

330
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,694
My orders are to return from here immediately,
and I can't disobey those orders.

331
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,779
I think we can
get through all right, Curley.

332
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,781
Oh, now, don't egg him on, Kid.

333
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:56,786
I'm drivin' this here outfit,
and, well, if the soldiers go back, so am I.

334
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,498
I call this a desertion of duty.
I'll report you to your superior officer.

335
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,750
If necessary,
I'll take the matter up with Washington!

336
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,920
That's your privilege, sir,
but if you give us any trouble here...

337
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,922
I'll have to put you under restraint.

338
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,633
Now, don't lose your temper.
Don't lose your temper.

339
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:14,387
I'll tell you how we'll settle it. We'll take a vote.
Inside, everybody. Come on, Buck.

340
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,848
Oh, Curley, I don't wanna go to -

341
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,438
Now you girls set yourselves down.
I'll get you something to eat.

342
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,358
Now, folks, if we push on,
we can be in Apache Wells by sundown.

343
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,903
Soldiers there will give us an escort
as far as the ferry.

344
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,405
Then it's only a hoot and a holler
into Lordsburg.

345
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,408
- Well, that old mare, I don't -
- We've got four men can handle firearms.

346
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,410
Five with you, Ringo.

347
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,163
Doc can shoot, if sober.

348
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,956
I can shoot?

349
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,583
I can shoot?

350
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:48,671
Now, Miss Mallory, I - I ain't gonna put
a lady in danger without she votes for it.

351
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,008
I've traveled all the way here
from Virginia.

352
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,510
I'm determined to get to my husband.

353
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,096
I won't be separated any longer.

354
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,767
- What's your vote, mister?
- [Clears Throat] Well -

355
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,562
Where's your manners, Curley?
Ain't you gonna ask the other lady first?

356
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,193
Well, what do you say?

357
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:18,409
What difference does it make?
Doesn't matter.

358
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:24,540
I vote that we go on. I demand it.
I'm standing on my legal rights.

359
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,960
What do you say, Hatfield?

360
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,841
Lordsburg.

361
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,345
Four. You, Doc?

362
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,181
I'm not only a philosopher, sir.

363
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,891
I'm a fatalist.

364
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:46,896
Somewhere, sometime, there may be
the right bullet or the wrong bottle...

365
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,815
waiting for Josiah Boone.

366
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,693
- Why worry when or where?
- [Curley] Yes or no?

367
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:56,656
Having that philosophy, sir,
I've always courted danger.

368
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,660
During the late war, when I had
the honor to serve the Union...

369
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,496
under our great president,
Abraham Lincoln...

370
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,666
ah, and General Phil Sheridan...

371
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,087
well, sir, I fought 'midst
shot and shell and cannon roar!

372
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,881
- Do you want to go back or not?
- No!

373
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,717
I want another drink.

374
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,136
[Laughing]

375
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,264
That's five.
How about you, Mr. Hancock?

376
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,267
It's Peacock. [Clears Throat]
I'd like to go on, brother.

377
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,688
I want to reach the bosom of my dear family
in Kansas City, Kansas, as quickly as possible...

378
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,190
but I may never reach that bosom
if we go on.

379
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,693
So, under the circumstances -
You understand, brother -

380
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,156
I think it best we go back with the bosoms -
[Stammers] I mean, the soldiers.

381
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,158
One against. Well, Buck?

382
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,160
- I want -
- Buck says aye. That's six.

383
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm voting your proxy, Kid.
You go with me.

384
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,206
Ain't nothin' keeping me
out of Lordsburg, Curley.

385
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,042
There sure ain't.

386
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,627
Well, folks, that settles it.
We're going through.

387
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,131
Sit down, folks, and eat your grub.
Come on, Buck. We'll change them horses.

388
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,343
- But, Curley, ain't we gonna eat? Ohh!
- You can eat later!

389
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:58,468
Here you are, folks.

390
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,345
Here you are, folks.

391
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,056
Food's on the table. Help yourselves.

392
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,516
You got a long ride ahead of ya.

393
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,811
You ain't drinkin', Billy.

394
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,897
Sit down here, ma'am.

395
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,237
Thanks.

396
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:54,649
May I find you another place, Mrs. Mallory?
It's cooler by the window.

397
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,613
Thank you.

398
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,474
Looks like I got the plague, don't it?

399
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,352
No. No, it's not you.

400
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:35,106
Well, I guess you can't break out of prison
and into society in the same week.

401
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,525
Please! Please.

402
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,002
You're ill, Mrs. Mallory.

403
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,087
No, it's just that I -

404
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,257
I'll be all right.

405
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,845
You've been very kind. Why?

406
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,390
In the world I live in,
one doesn't often meet a lady, Mrs. Mallory.

407
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,977
Have you ever been in Virginia?

408
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,438
I was in your father's regiment.

409
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:22,528
I should remember your name.
You're Mr. Hatfield.

410
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,614
That's what I'm called, yes.

411
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:39,545
- Why do you look at me like that?
- I'm just tryin' to remember.

412
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,964
Ain't I seen you someplace before, ma'am?

413
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,467
- No. No, you haven't.
- Hmm.

414
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,638
- I wish I had though.
- [Chuckles]

415
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,892
I know you.
I mean, I know who you are.

416
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,102
I guess everybody in the territory does.

417
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,896
Yep.

418
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,649
Well, I used to be a good cowhand, but...

419
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,818
things happened.

420
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,822
Yeah, that's it.

421
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,325
Things happened.

422
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,911
And now they'll take you back to prison.

423
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:16,123
Not till I finish a job in Lordsburg.

424
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,793
But you can't.
You're going there as a prisoner.

425
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,216
All aboard for Apache Wells, Lee's Fer -

426
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,593
All righty, folks, the horses are changed.
We'd better get going.

427
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,930
- And Lordsburg, maybe.
- All right, get going, Ringo.

428
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,933
Mrs. Pickett, tell Billy the buckboard
is all ready. Let's get going.

429
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,060
[Mrs. Pickett]
All right, Marshal, we're ready.

430
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,646
- Come on, folks, let's move.
- [Lieutenant] My compliments to your husband.

431
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,314
Thank you.

432
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,109
[Peacock] I still feel that we
ought to go back with the soldiers.

433
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,152
[Curley] We've got to hurry
if we wanna be there by sundown.

434
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,072
- [All Chattering]
- ♪♪ [Doc Singing]

435
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:12,031
Bridesmaid! Baby! Yow!

436
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,033
- What'd you say?
- Nothin'.

437
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,035
Well, why don't ya say somethin'?

438
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,830
A fella gets nervous, sittin' here like a dummy,
nothin' to think about but the Indians.

439
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,042
You say something! You've been sitting there
all day talking without making any sense!

440
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:27,213
All right, I'll say somethin' that makes sense.
If I was you, I'd let 'em shoot it out.

441
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,382
- Let who?
- Luke Plummer and the Kid.

442
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,884
There'd be a lot more peace
in this territory...

443
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,887
if that Luke Plummer was so full of lead
he couldn't hold his liquor.

444
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,181
I ain't sayin' I don't share
your sentiments, Buck.

445
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,266
- But you're a born fool.
- Well, I know that.

446
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,894
In the first place,
Luke would kill the Kid in a gunfight.

447
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,232
In the second place, if Luke did get shot,
he's got two brothers just as ornery as he is.

448
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:51,320
Nah, the only safe place for Ringo is in the pen,
and I aim to get him there all in one piece!

449
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,490
Well, I'll be doggoned
if I didn't do you an injury, Curley.

450
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,576
- I figured you were after the reward.
- Reward?

451
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:02,081
Why, the Kid's old man and me was friends.
We used to punch cattle together.

452
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,126
Besides, I could use that 500 in gold.

453
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,421
- Bridesmaid!
- Uh-uh! Steady!

454
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,424
Steady, girl!
Bridesmaid! In line!

455
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,301
I can't get over the impertinence
of that young lieutenant.

456
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,972
I'll make it warm for that shavetail!
I'll report him to Washington!

457
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,558
We pay taxes to the government,
and what do we get?

458
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:24,520
- Not even protection from the army.
- No.

459
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,314
I don't know what the government
is coming to.

460
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,943
Instead of protecting businessmen,
it pokes its nose into business.

461
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,695
Hmph!

462
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,698
Why, they're even talking now
about having bank examiners.

463
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,410
As if we bankers
don't know how to run our own banks!

464
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,413
Why, Boone, I actually had a letter
from a popinjay official...

465
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,749
saying they were going
to inspect my books!

466
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,128
I have a slogan that should be blazoned
on every newspaper in the country -

467
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
America for Americans!

468
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,424
The government
must not interfere with business!

469
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,470
Reduce taxes!
Our national debt is something shocking!

470
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:00,139
Over $1 billion a year!

471
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,642
What this country needs
is a businessman for president!

472
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,979
What this country needs
is more fuddle.

473
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,316
- What?
- Fuddle!

474
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,443
You're drunk, sir!

475
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,278
I'm happy, Gatewood.

476
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,696
Boo!

477
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,180
How come you're taking this road?
It's gonna be cold up there.

478
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,182
I'm usin' my head.

479
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,101
Those breech-clad Apaches don't like snow.

480
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,829
Maybe you'd like to -
to sit next to me.

481
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,415
I - You could put your head
on my shoulder.

482
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,795
No, thank you.

483
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,475
How are you feeling, Mrs. Mallory?

484
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,938
Is there any water?

485
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,692

00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,901
[Chris]
Curley! Oh, Curley!

660
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,194
Oh! Curley! Curley!

661
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,322
- What's wrong, Chris?
- My wife, Yakima - she run away.

662
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,241
- When I wake up, she was gone.
- The way you come busting in here, you'd think -

663
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,244
- Whoa.
- Excuse me, Kid.

664
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,496
Come busting in here,
you'd think we were being attacked.

665
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,750
- You can find another wife.
- Sure I can find another wife.

666
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,877
But she take my rifle and my horse.

667
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,630
Oh, I never sell her.
I love her so much.

668
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,549
I beat her with the whip,
and she never get tired.

669
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,676
- Your wife?
- No. My horse.

670
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,469
Oh.

671
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:28,473
I can find another wife easy, yes,
but not a horse like that.

672
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,308
Mala Yakima.

673
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,393
I knew that woman was a thief, by -

674
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,231
What's the matter with you, Gatewood?

675
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:41,069
My valise! Where's my valise?
Which one of you have got it?

676
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,488
Here it is. I was usin' it for a pillow.
I didn't think you'd mind.

677
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,615
I thought I told you
to keep your hands off my things!

678
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,909
Yes, sir.

679
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:54,582
That squaw of yours will find some Apaches
and bring 'em back here.

680
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,168
My wife's people don't bother me, I think.

681
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,170
Well, they bother me, I think.

682
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,507
Chris, is this bar open?

683
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,842
Sure, all the time, señor. Si.

684
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,844
Good.

685
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,598
Here you are, Doc.

686
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,438
Well, what are we wasting time for?
Let's make a break for it.

687
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,733
- We've got a sick woman to think of.
- Do you want her to stay here
and be butchered with the rest of us?

688
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,736
- Why don't you think of somebody else for once?
- Do you realize who you're talking to?

689
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:27,490
Easy, easy! Quiet, boys. Quiet.

690
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,867
We ain't been butchered yet.

691
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,911
But you're right.

692
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,539
We'd better get going for Lordsburg
as soon as we can.

693
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:39,752
Might be a good idea, Curley, if, uh,
Doc took a look at the patient.

694
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,504
Yeah, and Little Coyote.

695
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,718
You'll join me, Doctor?
[Clears Throat]

696
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,346
No, thanks.

697
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,200
Morning.

698
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,327
Well, you're looking pretty chipper.

699
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,460
Hmm. You're up early, Dallas.

700
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,592
She didn't go to bed, Doctor.

701
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,928
I'm afraid she sat up all night
while I slept.

702
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,598
Oh, I slept a lot in the chair.

703
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:41,230
Well, anyway, it was nice to stay awake
and hold the baby.

704
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:45,359
Hmm. Well, we've got to get you
to Lordsburg, Little Coyote.

705
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:49,614
That's what the boys christened her last night
when she squalled - Little Coyote.

706
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:53,284
- How do you feel?
- Fine, thanks. A little tired.

707
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,788
- Doctor, do you think my husband -
- Never mind him.

708
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:00,083
The best medicine he can have
is to see you two safe and sound.

709
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,085
You just make up your mind
you're gonna get there.

710
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,378
- I have made up my mind.
- That's the stuff.

711
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,965
- I am going to get there.
- You need strength, so get all the rest you can.

712
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,384
Dallas, do you suppose
you can fix up a little broth?

713
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,386
- She has already.
- Good.

714
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,056
How about making some coffee
for the boys?

715
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,144
Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.

716
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,688
And don't look so proud.

717
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,775
I've brought hundreds
of those little fellas into the world...

718
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,319
once upon a time.

719
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,613
And the new one
was always the prettiest.

720
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,741
Doc.

721
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,416
Ringo asked me to marry him.

722
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,255
Is that wrong for a girl like me?

723
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:52,093
If a man and woman love each other,
it's all right, ain't it, Doc?

724
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,264
You're going to be hurt, child.

725
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,768
Worse than you've ever been hurt.

726
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:03,229
Don't you know that boy's
headed back for prison?

727
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:09,694
Besides, if you two
go into Lordsburg together...

728
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,779
he's going to know all about you.

729
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,790
He's not goin' into Lordsburg.

730
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,879
All I want is for you
to tell me it's all right.

731
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:32,216
Gosh, child, who am I to tell you
what's right or wrong?

732
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:38,389
All right. Go ahead.

733
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,850
Do it if you can.

734
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,145
Good luck.

735
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,147
Thanks, Doc.

736
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,532
- Ringo -
- [Curley] Well, Doc?

737
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,743
Oh, both doing nicely.

738
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,912
She's a real soldier's wife,
that young lady.

739
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,747
Good, good.
Then we can leave immediately.

740
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,584
Well, not for a day or so
if you want my professional advice.

741
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,462
What do you mean a day?
Stay another day? Why?

742
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,007
Where were you when the stork
came last night, Gatewood?

743
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:17,261
I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel
until she and the child are out of danger.

744
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:20,139
What do you mean danger?
Aren't we in worse danger here?

745
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,308
[Clears Throat]
I don't wish to intrude.

746
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,436
But I've had five children.
I mean, my dear wife has.

747
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,440
And much as I dislike discussing it,
in this hour of our trial...

748
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,484
I - I believe the doctor's right.

749
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,486
Spoken like a man, Reverend.

750
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,781
I say we ought to leave here before the
Apaches find us. That's common sense.

751
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,783
I wish you were 10 years younger,
Gatewood.

752
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,868
- Don't let my white hairs stop you -
- Now just a minute!

753
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,662
- [Both Shouting]
- Quiet! Quiet!

754
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,623
- Now, Curley, I haven't said a word!
- Will you shut up!

755
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,125
Now, if we argue this thing out right,
we can get somewhere.

756
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,878
Let's all sit down and talk sensible.

757
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,964
Come on, Buck. Sit down.

758
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,136
There's a young woman in the kitchen
making coffee.

759
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,222
She needs help.

760
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,726
Thanks, Doc.

761
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,812
Say, Kid.

762
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,607
How old were you
when you went to the pen?

763
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:14,819
Oh, I was... goin' on 17.

764
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,831
[Grinding]

765
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:32,044
Mornin', ma'am.

766
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,130
Morning.

767
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,428
I, uh, laid awake most of the night...

768
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:45,349
wondering what you'd have said
if Curley hadn't busted in.

769
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:50,313
Guess you was up kind of late too.

770
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,398
I could hear you moving around.

771
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,610
You didn't answer
what I asked you last night.

772
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,866
Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?

773
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,868
There's a horse out there in the corral.

774
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:08,039
Curley won't go after you because he can't
leave the passengers in a fix like this.

775
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,541
I gotta go to Lordsburg.

776
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,210
Why don't you go to my ranch
and wait for me?

777
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,880
Wait for a dead man.

778
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,882
You haven't got a chance.

779
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:22,345
It was three against one when the Plummers swore
that you killed their foreman, got you sent up.

780
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,680
It'll be three against one in Lordsburg.

781
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,516
Well, there's some things a man
just can't run away from.

782
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,980
How can you talk about your life and my life
when you're throwing them away?

783
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:34,982
Yeah. Mine too.

784
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,568
That's what you're throwing away
if you go to Lordsburg.

785
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,570
What do you want me to do?

786
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,700
Would it make us any happier
if Luke Plummer was dead?

787
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,786
One of his brothers
would be after you with a gun.

788
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,788
We'd never be safe.

789
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,790
I don't want that kind of life, Ringo.

790
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,376
Well, I don't see what else I can do.

791
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,461
Go now. Get away.

792
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,922
Forget Lordsburg. Forget the Plummers.

793
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,924
Make for the border, and I'll come to you.

794
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,842
- Do you mean that?
- Yes, I do.

795
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,553
Will you go with me, Dallas?

796
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:08,599
Oh, I can't leave Mrs. Mallory
and the baby.

797
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,477
I'll come to you from Lordsburg.
I swear it.

798
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,479
Well, I oughta have a rifle and -

799
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,065
I've got one. Right here.

800
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,902
- I got it last night when they were all asleep.
- You mean you thought of this last night?

801
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,488
Yeah. Don't ask any more questions.
Not now.

802
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:24,156
Aw, gosh, Curley,
there ain't no Apaches behind us.

803
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,700
Aw, gosh, Curley,
there ain't no Apaches behind us.

804
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,452
We can still go back to Tonto.

805
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:32,373
- No! I insist we go on to Lordsburg.
- What do you think, Chris?

806
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:36,877
Geronimo between here and Lordsburg -
with my horse, I think.

807
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:41,048
- [Chuckles] ♪ My horse has gone ♪
- No, Doctor. Oh! [Mutters In Spanish]

808
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:44,093
♪ She has gone astray with the sun - ♪♪

809
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,138
Quiet, Doc.
This is a serious matter, ain't it?

810
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,141
My dear Buck...

811
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:54,520
if I have only one hour to live,
I'm going to enjoy myself.

812
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,314
Doctor, I don't begrudge you my samples,
but I think -

813
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,483
Now you hush! I've stood enough of you.

814
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:03,654
Now this is a serious problem,
and I'm the only one that's talkin' sense.

815
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:07,032
- Now, Curley, if -
- If we can get across that ferry,
we'll be all right.

816
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:11,704
Question is, what are we gonna do
about the lady and her baby?

817
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,039
Dr. Boone has settled that for us, sir...

818
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,375
and I demand respect
for his professional opinion.

819
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,253
Hatfield.

820
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,339
Ringo.

821
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:25,050
Ringo!

822
