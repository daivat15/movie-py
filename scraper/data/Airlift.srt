1
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,708
And finally...

2
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:56,917
How do you fit 30 Iraqis
in one telephone booth?

3
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,292
Tell them that it
does not belong to them!

4
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,417
Goodbye!

5
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,667
Congratulations!

6
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,250
You're very kind, Excellency.

7
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,250
Oh, I'm a mere Prince, Ranjit.

8
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,958
Answerable to His Excellency.

9
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,167
The Emir.

10
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,292
But Ranjit,
you know this deal would mean...

11
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,125
...a lot of your friends
will be unhappy with you.

12
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,375
So, how do you explain to them?

13
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,542
To me, profit explains everything.

14
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,667
Everything.

15
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,583
Always the shrewd businessman.

16
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,708
You should rule, Your Excellency...

17
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,083
...and let me slave in peace.

18
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,667
Goodbye!

19
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,292
Heemaar!

20
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,333
Sorry, sir?

21
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,333
Donkey, Nair, Donkey!

22
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,250
Your India is fully of them

23
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,333
But seems like only
I run into them in Kuwait.

24
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,750
Play some music.
- Okay, sir.

25
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,708
Nair, you're still not a Kuwaiti.

26
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,625
Haven't you learnt anything from me.

27
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,000
Sorry, sir.

28
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,417
Thank you.

29
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,667
Just have a little.

30
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Simu, that's it

31
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,000
Goodnight.
- No, mama...five minutes.

32
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,375
No five minutes, that's it.

33
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,750
Simu.

34
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:40,333
Simu. Come on, jump. Jump. Jump.

35
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:44,000
Jump. Jump. Jump.

36
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,958
Goodnight.

37
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,125
Where's my kiss.

38
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,792
Goodnight.

39
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,958
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't be scared.

40
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:52,667
Rita. - Yes, ma'am.
- Just tuck her in

41
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,833
Keep the door open.

42
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,167
Why is Simu still awake?

43
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,625
Don't worry,
we won't be late for the party.

44
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,292
And anyway...she's a kid,
not your car...

45
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,958
...that you can turn off with a key.

46
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,583
You've already started?

47
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,792
Decide... whether you want
to party or fight?

48
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,958
Me?

49
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,708
OK. Let's party.

50
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,917
Nair, your family must be thrilled.

51
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,917
Yes, madam.

52
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,375
It's my daughter's
first visit to India.

53
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,750
Look ahead, Nair.

54
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,792
This isn't India.

55
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,583
Ranjit.
- What?

56
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,875
Fine, fine...take
your daughter along too.

57
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,625
She's only four years old...

58
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,083
No one will ask her
for any bribe either.

59
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,083
Take her to India.
She'll like it.

60
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,833
Be in a good mood.
- We'll see.

61
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,500
And please don't drink too much.
- We'll see.

62
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,458
Hey, guys.
- How are you, Ranjit?

63
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,375
Hello, how are you?
- Very good. Hi.

64
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,750
Hi, you're looking beautiful.
As usual.

65
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,958
Hi, how are you?

66
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,083
So nice to see you.

67
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:04,875
Ashok.

68
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:06,708
How are you?

69
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:07,792
Well...

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,833
Ranjit, where's Prem?
- Prem?

71
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,667
I invited him...
Hasn't he shown up yet?

72
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,958
You ruined him,
and then invited him..

73
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,292
Why would he come?

74
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,250
The Fawad deal was his, Ranjit.

75
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,375
You snatched it.

76
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,708
You should never mix
business and friendship

77
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,542
It's his problem
that he didn't show up.

78
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,458
Even witches spare friends.
- I am a demon.

79
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,708
How about some blood?
- No, Mr. Demon.

80
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,458
You drink it.
- Thank you.

81
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:23,042
"My heart's lost
in those Arabic eyes."

82
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,667
"Your lies have plundered me."

83
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:41,208
"My heart's lost
in those Arabic eyes."

84
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,917
"Your lies have plundered me."

85
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,792
"My heart's lost

86
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,292
"Your lies have plundered me."

87
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,333
"|t was lying inside my chest..."

88
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,458
"...in the season of love."

89
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,458
"A single gesture..."

90
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,833
"...and I gave my heart to you.

"Gave it..."

98
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,875
"Magnificent...simp|y magnificent."

99
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,125
"You're just so addictive."

100
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,375
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

101
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,667
"Amazing..."

102
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,000
"Your attitude's simply amazing."

103
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,250
"You're so stubborn."

104
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500

105

Go! Go! Go fast!

123
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:37,250
You go to the right.

124
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,667
Hello.

125
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,500
Hold on.

126
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,042
‘Iraq and Kuwait had shared
a tense relationship for some time.‘

127
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,917
‘The tension was caused
by what always causes tension‘

128
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,375
‘Money.’

129
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,625
‘Iraq owed Kuwait 14 billion dollars...‘

130
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,375
'...that Iraq wanted waived.‘

131
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,500
Okay, I'll call you later.

132
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,417
‘They were also demanding that
Kuwait produce less oil...‘

133
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,042
'...s0 that oil prices go up...‘

134
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,792
'...and Iraq profits more.‘

135
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,042
‘Amidst these apologies
and threats...‘

136
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,375
'...the Iraqis also
accused the Kuwaitis of...

137
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,125
'...stea|ing oil.‘

138
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,083
‘We had grown used
to these threats by now.‘

139
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,917
‘And believed that the
situation wouldn't change‘

140
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,625
‘But we were wrong.‘

141
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,917
‘It did.‘

142
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,875
‘And along with it, changed
the identities of us Kuwaitis.‘

143
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,958
Ranjit?

144
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,417
Ashok called.
- At 3am?

145
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,625
Apparently Saddam attacked Kuwait.
- Come on, Ranjit.

146
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,500
I am sure there must have been
some minor action at the border.

147
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,667
Ranjit...|t's 1990
- I've an idea.

148
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,667
Simran and you go to London.

149
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,917
Do you really think
there's some kind of threat?

150
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,042
I don't think so.

151
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,333
I'm sure schools will
be closed for few days.

152
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,917
You can come back in a week.

153
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
And everything will be fine.

154
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,250
Could Saddam have rea||y..
- Nothing has happened.

155
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,375
What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, ljust...

156
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,208
Do me a favour.
Go back to bed.

157
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,875
Go! Ijust want to make some calls.

158
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,000
Go. Carry on. - Okay.
- Go, go.

159
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,875
Kuwaitis! Come out!

160
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,125
This is our land now!

161
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,042
Hail Saddam!
- Get down.

162
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,042
Hail Saddam!

163
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:03,875
Hail Saddam!

164
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,875
Hail Saddam!

165
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:05,708
Hail Saddam!

166
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,625
Hail Saddam!

167
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,667
Hail Saddam!

168
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,333
- Oh God! How bad is it?
- Very bad!

169
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,917
Just when I need them
most no one takes my calls.

170
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,625
Did you try Sheikh Faisal
at the Internal Ministry?

171
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,125
Don't tell me who to call.

172
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,667
Why are you shouting?
- I've already tried him, Amrita.

173
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,458
Relax, Ranjit.

174
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,417
The entire Kuwaiti Government is gone.

175
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,083
There's not a single official here.

176
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,417
We're practically without
a government, and you are...

177
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,375
Gone?
- Yes.

178
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,958
They ran away the
first chance they got.

179
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,458
Don't they have any responsibility...

180
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,542
...towards their own people?

181
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,042
Amrita...
- Mummy.

182
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,250
Why is Simu awake?

183
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,500
There's no school today.
Go. Go back to sleep.

184
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,125
Rita, please take her inside.

185
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,917
Go, baby. Go inside, please.

186
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
Nair, what's happening outside?

187
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,125
Sir, I avoided the main roads...

188
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,333
...and took the highway to get here.

189
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,792
The Iraqi army is everywhere.

190
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,833
They're checking everyone.

191
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,167
They're sparing everyone else...

192
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,333
...but seeking out
Kuwaitis and killing them.

193
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,833
Ranjit, why did you call him..?
- Amrita, mind your own business...

194
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,250
...and let me do mine.

195
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,583
Get the car, I'll go get ready.

196
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,500
Now you're going out too!?
- Just calm down.

197
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,750
What's wrong with you?

198
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:51,875
I'm going to the Embassy.

199
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,917
We'll get out of Kuwait
once everything's arranged.

200
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,708
Okay. Relax now.

201
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,625
Nair, don't be scared.

202
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,375
Stop the car!

203
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,167
Turn the car off!

204
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,083
Get out! Where are you going?

205
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,042
Do you have any papers?

206
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,667
He's my boss.
- Nair, don't speak in arabic.

207
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,833
Nair, get in the car.
Nair don't speak in arabic.

208
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,208
He's my boss.

209
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,375
Get in!

210
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,042
Play the music

211
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,917
What's that shining in your hand?
Give it to us.

212
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,875
Good, good!

213
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,125
Let's go

214
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,542
Come on, move.

215
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,125
‘You must be really happy today‘.

216
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,708
Amitabh Bachchan...?

217
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,708
Deewar...?

218
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,750
Mr. Ranjit, yes or no?

219
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,083
If I hadn't passed through
that checkpoint today...

220
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,667
...then you wouldn't be still alive,
Mr. Ranjit.

221
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,125
Let me guess...

222
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,208
You didn't recognise me.

223
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,125
A year ago...you came to Baghdad...

224
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,500
...with your wife Amrita
and daughter Simran...

225
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,000
...for a Fundraiser.

226
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:21,125
And by the grace of Allah...
who was your security in-charge?

227
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,167
I was with you for two days...

228
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,583
...yet you don't recognise me.

229
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,500
I am kind of hurt, Mr. Katiyal.

230
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,250
I remember...
- No! You don't!

231
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,167
Successful people...
should only remember important people.

232
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:52,333
And n0w...sudden|y...
I am someone important.

233
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:57,792
Mr. Khallaf Bin Zayed.
Iraqi Republican Army.

234
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,000
At your service.
- Thank you.

235
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,417
I'll give you plenty
of opportunities...

236
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,625
...to express your gratitude.

237
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,125
Like I gave him.

238
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,833
Fawad?

239
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,542
Fawad AI Sayyed.

240
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,417
Your business partner.

241
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,542
AI An Hazir Iraq, Mr. Katiyal.

242
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,417
Now this is Iraq.

243
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,667
And people like you...

244
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,458
...wi|| help us keep it that way.

245
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm taking another step towards that.

246
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,000
A small gift.

247
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,333
This sticker.

248
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,500
Put it on the windshield of your car.

249
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,417
It'll be helpful at checkpoints.

250
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,333
Otherwise...we could
be meeting every day.

251
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,375
We're friends now, Mr. Ranjit.

252
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,958
If you ever need anything...

253
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,458
...d0n‘t hesitate.

254
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,458
In return...|'m sure
you too honor this friendship.

255
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,042
You can go.

256
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,042
Mr. Saini.

257
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:23,958
Mr. Saini.

258
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,875
Mr. Katiyal, over here.

259
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,917
Thank God you saw me.

260
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,000
It's okay.

261
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,542
Brij!

262
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,125
Brij! What the hell is happening?

263
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,917
What happened? Calm down.

264
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,042
A 16 year old Iraqi
soldier shot my driver.

265
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,208
They dragged me to the Dasman palace.

266
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,458
I couldn't tell if...

267
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:50,125
...that Iraqi Major
was being friendly...

268
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,375
...0r threatening me.

269
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,458
And you're asking what happened?

270
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,667
Come, sit.

271
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,792
Have some water.

272
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,833
We'll sort it out, don't worry.

273
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,167
I am sorry.
- No, it's okay.

274
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,542
What is the airport situation?

275
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,833
The Iraqis have control over it.

276
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,583
No one can come in.

277
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,292
And there's no question of leaving.

278
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,875
And the Indian Government?

279
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,667
As usual, must be watching the show.

280
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,625
Your Kuwaiti government...

281
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,125
...didn't even wait
for the show to start.

282
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,167
They fled.

283
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,208
Policy decisions
are not made in hours.

284
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,750
And the entire world's
watching the show.

285
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,417
Brij, do something.

286
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,333
Get me and my family out of here.

287
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:48,542
We have to get out.

288
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,958
Yes. And so do another 170,000 Indians.

289
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,750
But how will you?

290
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,917
Okay...do one thing.

291
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,292
Bring your family here.

292
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,958
Take her.

293
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:54,833
Look! What a fancy house!

294
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:24,875
- Look, a Kuwaiti Teddy!
- Dead Kuwaiti Teddy!

295
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,875
There's no point going home.
We'll just stay here and...

296
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,625
Joseph, did anyone call from home?

297
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,542
Ranjit.

298
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,125
D0 you know how scared I was?
- Papa!

299
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,250
You have no idea how I
brought Simu in here.

300
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,625
Where were you?

301
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,292
Ranjit, please. Let's just leave.

302
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,333
You were saying that
we should go to London.

303
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,625
Let's go to London.

304
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,458
Just get us out of here.
- Nair's been shot.

305
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,875
Are you even listening?
- Amrita, Nair's been shot.

306
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,500
Nair?

307
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,375
So were you at the hospital?

308
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,792
How is he now?

309
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,167
Ranjit.

310
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,292
Ranjit.
- He's dead.

311
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,333
What?
- Yeah...

312
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,167
They killed him...
right in front of my eyes.

313
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,250
Little kids are walking
around with guns.

314
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,250
Fawad AI Sayyed was
hanging off a crane.

315
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,167
Oh my...
- So what is Ranjit Katiyal worth?

316
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,000
I couldn't even ask
about Nair's body.

317
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,667
His wife just called.

318
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,208
Mr. Ranjit, why are you standing?

319
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,000
Please sit.
- Thank you.

320
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,292
Not here.

321
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,292
Here.

322
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,542
There's a price to everything,
Mr. Ranjit.

323
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,292
I am ready to pay.

324
00:33:56,875 --> 00:34:00,708
The Kuwaiti Dinar is worthless now.

325
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:06,042
300,000 dollars for 3 people.

326
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,708
We are five.
- Five?

327
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:13,875
My driver's wife and his child.

328
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,042
Driver's wife...

329
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,833
This is your chance to
get out with your family.

330
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,625
Don't get involved in social work...

331
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,667
...you'|| only get stuck further.

332
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,250
I'm not the type who gets stuck.

333
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:35,667
Anyway...| can arrange for your money.

334
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,542
Very good!

335
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,417
Thank you.

336
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,000
How much do we have?
- Earlier, there were 200.

337
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,292
And n0w..
- I'm talking about cash.

338
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:52,375
Sir, thank God you've come.

339
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,458
It now feels like
things will get better.

340
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,792
We're scared.

341
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:58,542
Please tell us what to do.

342
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,792
Sir...

343
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:27,208
Joseph, make a list of our
staff and their families.

344
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,500
See if we can accommodate
everyone here.

345
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,417
Otherwise,
we'll make other arrangements.

346
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,708
Relax everyone.

347
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,083
Sit.

348
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,625
Relax.

349
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:43,625
What do you think you're doing?

350
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,750
Why aren't you getting us out of here?

351
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,875
I can'tjust desert them, can I?

352
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,542
But you can desert us.

353
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,167
Don't you have any
responsibility towards us?

354
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:56,500
Of course I do.

355
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,667
But these people work for me.

356
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,833
They have the same
expectations from us...

357
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:03,000
...as we did
the Kuwaiti government.

358
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,375
"How can anyone run from
their responsibilities"...

359
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,125
...these were your words.
- Yes, they were.

360
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,208
But it's easy to make tall claims.

361
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,583
That was my mistake.

362
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,542
But you're making an even bigger one.

363
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,167
And why this sudden
urge to be a Messiah?

364
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,583
I have no interest in being a Messiah.

365
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,542
I too want to get us out of here.

366
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:28,208
But... once I make
some arrangements for them.

367
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,875
Take care of yourselves.

368
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,708
Soon we'll make some arrangements.

369
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,333
Did you eat?

370
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,750
Did you eat?

371
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,417
Are you okay?

372
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,708
Give me some space.

373
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,500
Where do you expect me to sleep?

374
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,208
Strange problem.

375
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,292
Calm down.

376
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,125
Isn't there enough of
a battle for space outside?

377
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,500
Stop being childish.

378
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,208
Come here.
Here.

379
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:23,208
Come on.

380
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,750
There's space here.

381
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:27,750
Excuse me.

382
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,250
The toilets have become very dirty.

383
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,375
They're stinking.

384
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,042
You're the boss, aren't you?

385
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,292
That's why I am telling you.

386
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,583
Do you work here?
- N0!

387
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,583
Let me know when it's clean.

388
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,750
I'm in this room.

389
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Hey, move aside.

390
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm not going to be called a refugee
along with these drivers and coolies...

391
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,500
- Sir, any problem?

392
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,875
Who is he?
- I don't know, sir.

393
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,125
Around 100 more came here last night.

394
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,667
There are many like him.

395
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,875
More than 1000 Indians
are waiting outside.

396
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,083
How did they get here?

397
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:07,708
Sir, they say they're friends,
relatives, etcetera...

398
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,333
...0f our employees.

399
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:10,375
They had nowhere to go.

400
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,833
So they came here...

401
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,042
...because they feel
safer when they're together.

402
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:20,042
Sir...it's hard to arrange
food for 500 people.

403
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,792
What will we do with 1600?

404
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,333
If you want, I can identify
those who work for us...

405
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,708
..and ask the rest to leave?

406
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,458
No!

407
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,167
Hello, sir.

408
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,208
This way.

409
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,083
Ranjit Wasn't Ranjit heading here?

410
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,458
But I heard the situation
is pretty bad in the city centre.

411
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,417
Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

412
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,125
Hey, Ranjit.
- He's here.

413
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,000
How are you?

414
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:06,500
Thank you.

415
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,792
Ranjit, you too?
In the day?

416
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,542
Saddam has turned
everything on its head.

417
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,625
Ranjit, when all
this is over tomorrow...

418
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:20,292
...you'|| have an exciting
story to tell your grandchildren.

419
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,917
Like "When uncle Saddam
was swirling Kuwait around..."

420
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,708
"...| was swirling a glass of
scotch in Kurien uncle's supermarket".

421
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:30,542
So it'll all be over tomorrow?
- Of course, Ranjit.

422
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,167
You think America will stay quiet?

423
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:33,750
So what is America waiting for?

424
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,667
For us to finish our scotch.

425
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,250
Calm down, Ranjit.

426
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,208
They'll keep us afraid of
the villain for a couple of days.

427
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:42,167
Then tell the Arabs,
‘look at what happened to Kuwait.‘

428
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,333
‘Let us in...bui|d a military base.‘

429
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,375
‘And we'll keep you safe.‘

430
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,292
And everything will
be back to business.

431
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,708
It's a question of a few days.

432
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,208
So gentlemen, this is everything.

433
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,042
You guys can take what you want.

434
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:54,917
Ranjit.

435
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,708
Ibrahim.
- Yes, sir.

436
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,792
Ranjit sir...|‘m sure
you haven't brought a truck.

437
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,583
So Ibrahim will load up...

438
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,417
...and deliver it to your office.

439
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,208
Tell me something...

440
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,292
Why are we dividing all the food?

441
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:15,083
Why don't we all
gather at one place...

442
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,208
...and take all the stuff there.

443
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,542
You know,
if we Indians stay together...

444
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,000
What happened?
- We Indians?

445
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,125
Oh, come on!

446
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,875
Since when did you
become an Indian, Ranjit?

447
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,542
Weren't you always a Kuwaiti.

448
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:32,750
Ranjit, let's just take the
first flight out of here.

449
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,333
Saddam has attacked them.

450
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,542
Why should we be bothered?

451
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,042
What's the bother?

452
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,917
All we need is a big space,
that's all.

453
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,500
It's a question of
couple of days, Ranjit.

454
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,250
What's the problem?
- Hold on.

455
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:49,917
Ranjit is right.
- Let's solve our own problems.

456
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,625
Trying to help 170,000...

457
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,667
...wi|| only add to our problems.

458
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,083
Come on, Ibrahim.

459
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,083
Ashok...

460
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,042
...outside of this supermarket...

461
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,542
nobody recognizes you or me.

462
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,000
We have no standing.

463
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,042
The only thing we
have is our identity.

464
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,333
We're Indian, not Kuwaiti.

465
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,542
Together we're something...

466
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:23,542
If not...

467
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,750
Nothing!

468
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,458
It's old whiskey... but not
worth 500,000 dollars, Mr. Ranjit.

469
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,125
I did try to tell you...

470
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:47,333
Getting involved
in social work is a trap.

471
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:50,833
That's not it, sir.

472
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,167
Once the camp is set up...

473
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,458
...|'|| leave with my wife and child.

474
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,750
As long as you're with us.

475
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,625
Aah...you're trying to flatter me.

476
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:06,208
Even the President considers
Indians as friends.

477
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,792
You can setup camp anywhere you want.

478
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,250
You have my permission.
- Thank you.

479
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,708
But why take your family to the camp?

480
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:19,917
Tell your wife it's safe at home.

481
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,458
You have my word.

482
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,583
Thank you.

483
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,458
Move.

484
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:03,750
Come on.

485
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,417
Excuse me.

486
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,500
There are classrooms at the back.

487
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:44,667
You can sleep there.

488
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:46,500
There are bathrooms here too.

489
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:49,625
There's water available
here.

490
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,833
And Ash0k's trying to find out.

491
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,958
You see...we can put up tents here...

492
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:57,667
...and let people sleep.

493
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,417
Why not.

494
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,958
Ranjit.
- Yes, Ashok.

495
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:02,792
The canteen‘s on that side.
We can serve them meals in there.

496
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:24,625
Simu, out of the bus!

497
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:28,083
I told you to stay right here!

498
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:29,208
Come on.

499
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,042
Come here.

500
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:35,375
You can stay here.

501
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:39,417
This is my "199399-

502
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,917
What do you mean by that?

503
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:48,000
This is my room.
- No, we'll shift to some other room.

504
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:52,958
It should be first come, first served.

505
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,625
I saw it first.

506
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,083
What do you think this is...

507
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,667
‘finders keepers‘?

508
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:00,208
We'll g0..
- N0, no, not at all.

509
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:03,667
If she's okay...

510
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:11,667
Nonsense!

511
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,083
Come here.

512
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,292
Come on, let's go.
- N0!

513
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,542
We won't stay here.

514
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,292
We'll all be together here.

515
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,125
It'll be safe.

516
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,167
Safe!

517
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:32,250
I found Simu playing with this!
A bullet!

518
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,833
You can help them settle down,
if you want.

519
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:37,708
Don't involve us.

520
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,625
Amrita...
- N0.

521
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:42,750
When you're ready,
pick us up from home.

522
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,417
The Major has guaranteed
our safety, hasn't he?

523
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:48,917
I'm leaving.

524
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:52,625
Are you coming?

525
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,708
Okay, sit.

526
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,083
I'll drop her home.
- Okay.

527
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,000
Take care of things.

528
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,708
What are you doing?

529
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:25,250
Get lost.

530
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:26,917
Get lost.

531
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,333
ls this a picnic?

532
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:32,917
There's a war going on...

533
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,542
Do you have any sense?

534
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,708
No discipline at all.

535
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,000
Look at him screaming.

536
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:39,042
Who's that?

537
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:41,125
It can be only one guy?
- Who?

538
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,458
My husband.

539
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,500
Let me take him...

540
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,042
While you eat something.

541
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,958
I'll take it... We'll eat later.

542
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,542
Ashok, we've finished our scotch...

543
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,083
Where is America?

544
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,208
Forget America...Where's India?

545
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,917
Around 150,000 Indians are stuck here.

546
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,458
ls anyone concerned?

547
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,167
They haven't done anything for us.

548
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,083
It's not like we've done anything
for India either.

549
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,250
You might
not have done anything.

550
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,542
We send millions of Dinar to India.

551
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:41,083
They want our Dinar...

552
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,500
...but they don't care about our lives.

553
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:47,417
If this had
been a western country...

554
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,000
...their embassy would've
gotten their people out by now.

555
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,875
The embassy can do something...

556
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,833
...on|y if they know
that we've setup a camp.

557
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:56,333
How will they find out? When we..
- What's this?

558
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,500
There's no discipline in the camp.

559
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:03,958
What?

560
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,000
Didn't you hear?

561
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,458
I heard.

562
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,000
Good.

563
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,292
Let's go to the embassy.

564
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,917
Kurien, look there.
- Yes.

565
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,542
Where's everyone?
- Gone.

566
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:45,542
Gone?

567
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,000
Where's Brij?

568
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:48,958
The entire embassy has been evacuated.

569
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,292
I'm leaving too.

570
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:53,208
Saddam says there's no point in
having two embassies in one country.

571
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,750
All the embassies
are in Baghdad anyway.

572
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,583
So will all the Indians
go to Baghdad now?

573
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,750
N0 point yelling at me.

574
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,542
Talk to the External
Affairs Ministry in Delhi.

575
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,958
They'll tell you
what Indians should do.

576
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,083
What nonsense..
- Wait. Wait.

577
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,375
Do you have any number?

578
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,000
Someone we can call?

579
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,417
Mr. Mishra, come.

580
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:21,083
Come on.

581
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,542
Hello, Ministry of External Affairs.

582
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:59,125
This is Ranjit Katiyal
speaking from Kuwait city.

583
00:50:59,208 --> 00:50:59,958
Yes.

584
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:02,167
We've been given a few numbers...

585
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,167
By the way, who is this?

586
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,125
Joint Secretary, Sanjeev Kohli.

587
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:09,208
I wanted to talk to you about...

588
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:11,667
...the situation of
Indians living in Kuwait.

589
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,792
We Indians have setup
camp in Apex School...

590
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,958
Look,
I don't handle the Gulf Division.

591
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:20,458
You've been given the wrong number.

592
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:22,917
Look Mr. Kohli, we need help.

593
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,167
And we need it right now.

594
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,833
Well...

595
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,708
I'll communicate this...

596
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:34,792
...to the Joint
Secretary of the Gulf division.

597
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,542
Give me the number to your school.

598
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:40,917
For two ?

599
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,375
Green chilly?

600
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,000
N0, thanks.

601
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:48,500
Meher! Meher!

602
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,208
This is where we're going to live?

603
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,750
With these people?

604
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,792
I'm leaving!
- Dad!

605
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:59,208
They are killing people outside.

606
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,292
Meher, Saddam has guaranteed...

607
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,875
...that Iraqis won't hurt Indians.

608
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:04,833
How would they know...

609
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,250
...wh0's Kuwaiti, who's Indian?

610
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:08,500
Meher...The bank has
my entire life's savings...

611
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,708
...not yours!

612
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,625
I'm leaving!

613
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,167
It's okay, dear.

614
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,542
It'll be okay.

615
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,708
Let me do it.

616
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,458
Can I tie that for you.

617
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,292
Allow me...

618
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,042
What?

619
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,542
What did you say?

620
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,167
Are you Kuwaiti?

621
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,000
You go ahead.

622
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,667
Sheer insensitivity.

623
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,208
There's no communication from
the External Ministry yet.

624
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,792
While taking our number...
- Papa!

625
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:01,375
My sweetie-pie.

626
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,625
Hello, stranger.

627
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:07,958
This is the first nice
surprise after 2nd August.

628
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,250
You hardly ever come home.

629
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,792
S0 I have to bring Simu
here to see her father, don't I?

630
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:14,958
Thank you.

631
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:18,917
What's going on?

632
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,708
Nothing much. We've been trying to
reach the External Affairs Ministry...

633
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,333
...in Delhi for four days,
but haven't managed to.

634
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:24,792
Hello, ma'am.

635
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:25,708
How are you?
- Fine.

636
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:26,292
Yes.

637
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,375
Come, Simu.

638
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,250
I'll show you something really nice.

639
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:30,292
I've kept it aside for you.

640
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,917
Are you enjoying all this?
- What?

641
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,500
I have no idea when you come or go.

642
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:39,917
I'm trying to sort all this.

643
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,083
Our peop|e..
- Our people?

644
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,375
Our people?

645
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Calling Delhi every day,
playing Indian Indian...

646
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,667
Since when did you
start caring so much about them?

647
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:53,208
Whenever I spoke about
going to India... - Amrita.

648
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:57,500
Amrita, once we have some clarity
from Delhi about the status of our people...

649
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,417
...we‘|| get out of here.

650
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,917
Hello, ma'am.
- Yeah.

651
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:06,208
Will you answer one question?

652
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,042
And I'm not asking in anger.

653
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,917
Why? Why all this?

654
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:12,208
Why this charade?

655
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:16,750
And what are you
suddenly trying to be?

656
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,208
Ranjit?

657
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,583
Look at these people.
- Why?

658
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,500
Amrita, look at them.

659
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:32,125
Some of them have been
working in our office...

660
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:34,333
...for 5...10...12 years.

661
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:37,292
But I didn't even know their names.

662
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,333
Unfortunately, now I do.

663
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,042
If we walk away...

664
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:47,958
...we will be leaving these
names behind, notjust any crowd.

665
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,750
It's true, they're not related to us.

666
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,750
But neither was Nair.

667
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,000
And he lost his life.

668
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:00,708
And it's not like I'm giving up
my life for these people.

669
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,583
If I turn away now, won't you ask...

670
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:09,417
"Ranjit, what kind of a man are you?"

671
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:13,833
Ranjit!

672
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:22,000
Sir, we're Indians.

673
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,958
We have permission.

674
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,708
We have permission.

675
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,167
Run! Run!

676
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,250
They're coming!

677
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,958
Run!

678
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:05,417
Ismail, Mani. G0 hide the food.
- Okay.

679
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,833
Good to see you, Mr. Ranjit.

680
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,833
Where's my whiskey today?

681
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,125
Your soldiers came...

682
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,833
They looted our camp.

683
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,333
I am sorry.

684
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,333
But what can they do?

685
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,667
Baghdad sent us...

686
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,167
...but forgot our supplies.

687
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,500
They thought we could depend
on your hospitality.

688
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,375
But... why are you so worried?

689
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,083
It's not like they
really did anything to you.

690
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,083
Did they?

691
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,542
Maybe they will come back.

692
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:43,750
I can't stop them.

693
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,917
How do I ensure the
safety of my people?

694
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:49,833
Ranjit! Ranjit! Ranjit!

695
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:54,083
Now I know for sure you're trapped.

696
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:57,583
You can all leave Kuwait
anytime if you want.

697
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:01,375
The President, like me, is
a friend of Indians.

698
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,167
And he has already permitted...

699
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,125
...|ndians to leave.

700
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:08,667
You never told me that.
- You never asked.

701
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,417
And that's why you never told me?

702
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,417
May Allah be with you.

703
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,125
But Ranjit...te|| me..

704
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,208
Where will you go
with all these people?

705
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:30,667
Yes, sir?

706
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,708
Joseph.
My medicines are almost over.

707
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:34,500
I'll look into it, sir.

708
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,458
What if the soldiers come back?

709
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:38,583
There's nothing we can do, sir.

710
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:40,250
Joseph.
- Yes, sir.

711
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:41,625
Excuse me.

712
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,458
Make a list...

713
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,250
...of the people here.

714
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:46,208
Write down all their names.

715
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,708
We should know how
many people are here.

716
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,708
And what are we doing about food now?

717
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,750
Sir, we still have food for 2-3 days.

718
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:55,083
Ibrahim managed
to hide half the food.

719
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Thank God.
Well, that's good.

720
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,875
But why are you calling me?

721
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:04,708
I already passed on
the number to the Gulf Desk.

722
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:06,500
Sir, no one has called
from the Ministry yet.

723
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:07,917
And they probably never will.

724
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,208
I need your help.
- What?

725
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:13,375
Look, Saddam Hussain has permitted...

726
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,542
...us Indians to get out of Kuwait.

727
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:18,167
But we don't know where to go...

728
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,042
...when or how?

729
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,875
lf you could help us,
then it'll be really great.

730
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:25,458
Let me speak to the
Minister and call you back.

731
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,083
Excuse me, sir.

732
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:29,958
Yes, Kohli.

733
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,458
Those Indians stuck in Kuwait...

734
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,875
Talk to Sharma at the Gulf Desk.

735
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:37,583
Sir, if you could just
put in a word. - Kohli!

736
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,250
The Prime Minister's waiting for me.

737
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,833
Father's name, Vasudevan.

738
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,375
Trichur.

739
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:47,958
Okay, please.

740
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,167
Next.

741
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:53,458
Father's name, Amit.

742
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,042
Look.

743
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,458
We must tell sir now.

744
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,667
Ibrahim, have you lost your mind?

745
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,208
You shouldn't have
hidden this from me!

746
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,667
If those Iraqi soldiers
had found out...

747
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,958
...that she's a Kuwaiti.

748
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:19,958
They would've shot
everyone in the camp.

749
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Sir, I didn't think about that.

750
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,667
I only thought about what
they would've done to her.

751
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,292
But honestly, sir...

752
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:39,500
...what is the proof
that we're not Kuwaiti.

753
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:43,000
Most of them don't have any documents.

754
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,500
Agents have their passports.

755
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,708
Who will believe we're Indian?

756
01:01:57,792 --> 01:01:59,250
Mr. Ranjit Katiyal.

757
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,250
Look, I couldn't find out much.

758
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,125
But I was informed
by the Gulf Division that...

759
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:07,333
...you could possibly go to Jordan.

760
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,333
Possibly?

761
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:15,042
But Mr. Kohli,
many of us don't have passports.

762
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:18,792
What do we do?
- I don't know about that.

763
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,375
But...

764
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,667
D0 you have any contacts in Baghdad?

765
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:25,708
Are you crazy?

766
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,125
He'll go to Iraq?

767
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,333
Do you think it's a picnic?

768
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,250
Those boy soldiers,
who haven't even reached puberty...

769
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,292
Crazy!

770
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,792
Ashok, what choice do we have?

771
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:40,083
You said that so easily
but what choice do we have?

772
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,125
Those crazy Iraqis
can come back anytime.

773
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,667
They can blow up
ourscho0L

774
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,833
And what can we do?

775
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,375
Isn't it better that I go to Baghdad?

776
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:51,042
...Ta|k to some people.
I know some people.

777
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:52,750
We must do something.

778
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:55,208
We can't just sit here
with our hands tied.

779
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:04,250
Sir, there's a hospital up ahead.

780
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:06,292
Can we stop there for a minute...

781
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,625
If you don't mind...

782
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:10,500
Thank you.

783
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,250
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

784
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,125
Come on, let's get out of here.

785
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,250
Papen

786
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,500
Papen

787
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:45,958
Indian. Indian.

788
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:48,042
Sticker!

789
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:54,958
How did he get this?

790
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,583
Okay, let him go!

791
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,458
QDen the way!

792
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:02,000
- G0! Go!
- Thank you!

793
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,250
ls someone at the hospital?

794
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,625
I got married 8 days ago.

795
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,792
My bride's name is Shazin.

796
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,250
The ceremony was
to be two days later...

797
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:30,042
...a|ong with the send-off.

798
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:33,917
But...Saddam sent
his cavalry that night.

799
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:38,792
Shazin is a nurse at the hospital.

800
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:41,500
And she's been busy
at the hospital since then?

801
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,875
No, sir. She's not at the hospital...

802
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:45,208
...n0r was she at home.

803
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,667
I've been looking for her...

804
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:49,667
...but I haven't
found any trace of her.

805
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:07,625
Don't go, Ranjit. It's not safe.

806
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:12,500
Why don't you understand
me these days?

807
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,667
Neither of us understands the other.

808
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:20,958
It's the circumstances
that are wrong... Not us.

809
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:26,542
"| am going to love you so much."

810
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:33,250
"l'm going to love
you 100 times in a moment."

811
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:39,958
"|f you ever live me."

812
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:45,542

813
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:49,125
"|'ve forsaken the world for you."

814
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:52,375
"My breath stops on you."

815
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,167
"| love you so much."

816
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:58,625
"You can never imagine."

817
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:01,875
"|'ve forsaken the world for you."

818
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:05,000
"My breath stops on you."

819
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,958
"| love you so much."

820
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,333
"You can never imagine."

821
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:19,958
Sir, we've
setup camp in a school...

822
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:21,458
You haven't tried it yet.

823
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:22,917
Have some...

824
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,667
It's called Kleicha.

825
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,500
It's considered Iraq's
national biscuit.

826
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,542
I am talking about my prob|em..

827
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:32,958
I've heard a lot
about this boy lately.

828
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:35,333
But he made only 10
runs in the first innings...

829
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:36,667
...and then 27 in the second.

830
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,917
I think the selectors
don't have a clue.

831
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,500
I mean...they put anyone
in the Indian team.

832
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:45,250
Look, I'm not here
for your biscuits...

833
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:47,208
...nor to discuss anyone's future...

834
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:49,458
...on the Indian cricket team.

835
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:53,458
We're all trapped in a
war-zone in a foreign country.

836
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:56,958
And you are... - I am trying
to change the subject, Mr. Katiyal...

837
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:59,917
...because I know what you're facing.

838
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:02,625
I have no interest in hassling you.

839
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:05,875
How would we know if...

840
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,292
...everyone in your camp is Indian.

841
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,917
What if they turn out to
be Pakistani or Bangladeshi?

842
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:15,500
We can't issue them passports, can we?

843
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:23,500
I get it.

844
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:25,208
Thank you.

845
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,208
Sorry, Mr. Katiyal.

846
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:29,500
All I can offer you is this Kleicha.

847
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,208
Please take one.

848
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,125
At least take one.

849
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:41,792
Sir, anything?

850
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Iraqi biscuit. Kleicha.

851
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:05,000
lt doesn't feel like these
are the guys who just attacked Kuwait.

852
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,542
Thank you.

853
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,500
What now, sir?

854
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,792
D0 we even matter to Delhi?

855
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,792
We matter to ourselves.

856
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:23,500
We'll have to keep trying, what else?

857
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,458
We can't blame Delhi either.

858
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:27,917
There are many here...

859
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,792
...who didn't care
about Delhi until now.

860
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,958
They thought they were Kuwaiti.

861
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,917
That's human nature, Ibrahim.

862
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:41,083
When you're hurt,
you first call out to your mother.

863
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:45,375
I'll go call Kurien.

864
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:48,625
Yes, Kurien.

865
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,167
Nothing. Kuwaitis were of no help.

866
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,500
Just as the Indians weren't.

867
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:55,208
That leaves us with just one option.

868
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,583
I know some Iraqis.

869
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:58,583
I'll try asking them for help...

870
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:02,667
...to meet Saddam's
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.

871
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:05,375
Mr. Katiyal.

872
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:07,583
Hello.
- Hello.

873
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:10,958
Please.
- Thank you.

874
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,375
Would you like some tea?
- No. Thank you.

875
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,375
Have some.
- Thank you.

876
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,667
Mr. Katiyal,
this is what I can do for you.

877
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
There's a ship called Tipu Sultan...

878
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,542
...coming from India.

879
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:37,500
With 10,000 tons of food
and medical supplies for Iraq.

880
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:40,375
Indians have been good...

881
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:43,125
...when the whole
world was against us.

882
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,167
I can allow the Indians in Kuwait...

883
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,250
...t0 go on their ship back home.

884
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:51,167
Thank you.

885
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:53,625
Thank you, Mr. Aziz.

886
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,458
Thank you very much.

887
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,167
"The Night's over...and
the morning has arrived."

888
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:40,792
"Happiness has crossed all |imits."

889
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,208
"The Night's over...and
the morning has arrived."

890
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:45,708
"Happiness has crossed all |imits."

891
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,708
"My heart leaps and jumps..."

892
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:50,458
"...with the beat of the drums."

893
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:52,375
"Today I want to..."

894
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:55,375
"Today I want to dance."

895
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,792
"Today I want to dance."

896
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,375
"Today I want to dance."

897
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:03,333
"Today I want to dance."

898
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:09,875
Show me that step. Show it.

899
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,500
Hello, Mr. Ranjit.

900
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,917
How many people can get on that ship?

901
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,125
I don't know.

902
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,667
Women and children first.

903
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:21,542
And then the old men, I know.

904
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:22,542
Hold on.

905
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:26,292
Did you take it in
writing from Tariq Aziz?

906
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,375
What? Ranjit?

907
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,250
You simply took his word for it?

908
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,500
You must do things properly.

909
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,875
Paperwork is highly important.

910
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:43,417
I don't know how you handled
such a huge company.

911
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,583
That's good news, Mr. Katiyal.

912
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:04,542
See you soon.

913
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,083
Papa, what else will we see in India?

914
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:10,708
Well there‘s...there's...

915
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,583
You don't remember?
- No, sweetheart. Of course I do.

916
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:18,792
But if I tell you now,
it'll ruin your surprise.

917
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:24,375
"Every heart's high on joy."

918
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:28,167
"Life will be filled with bliss."

919
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,792
"|'m going to lift my
feet and dance all night."

920
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,500
"No 0ne's going to
feel tired and sit down."

921
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:38,250
"We're going to shake the
earth with the thump of our feet."

922
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,083
"|ts time for friends to rejoice."

923
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:44,000
"A|| thanks to God."

924
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:45,792
"Today I want to..."

925
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:49,042
"Today I want to dance."

926
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,333
"Today I want to dance."

927
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:53,958
"Today I want to dance."

928
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:56,833
"Today I want to dance."

929
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,792
Hello.

930
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:16,375
Yes, Mr. Kohli.
We were just leaving.

931
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:20,500
There's bad news, Mr. Katiyal.

932
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,750
UN has enforced an embargo on Iraq.

933
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:27,958
Which means...nothing
can enter or leave Iraq.

934
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,792
And...

935
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,917
Tipu Sultan has been stopped.

936
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:38,167
Unfortunately, it won't reach you.

937
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,958
It's being turned away to Dubai.

938
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:49,292
I'm so sorry.

939
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:12,917
The United Nations
has proposed the imposition...

940
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,875
...0f numerous sanctions
on Iraq for attacking Kuwait.

941
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,500
The UN has refused credibility...

942
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:22,625
...to the newly formed Kuwait
government after the attack.

943
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:28,000
They refuted Iraq's claim...

944
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,083
Where are you going?

945
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:33,083
Where would I go...

946
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:38,458
in this pigeon coop.

947
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:43,083
We used to have a
mansion back in Lahore.

948
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:45,917
We used to play football...

949
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,542
...and cricket in there!

950
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,583
For years you've been telling
me about a place...

951
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,417
...where I'm never
going to be able to go.

952
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,750
Laugh all you want, son.

953
01:15:54,833 --> 01:16:01,250
The Indians trapped in
Kuwait are faced with a dilemma.

954
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:06,250
Those who are forced to
leave their homes in a jiffy...

955
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,000
...they don't laugh.

956
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,125
Sir... Food is going to be a problem.

957
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,042
What do I do?

958
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,792
Farm the desert?

959
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,833
Why do you come to me?

960
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,208
Solve your own problems.

961
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,417
Saddam hasn't made me the Emir.

962
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,250
Ranjit, what are you saying?
- What else can I do?

963
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:31,083
Give them hope, and then shatter
it again? And again!

964
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,792
It's not your fault.

965
01:16:32,917 --> 01:16:34,708
And we can't even to talk
to those who are at fault.

966
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:35,958
Stay here!

967
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,292
We're not going inside!

968
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,583
Let's just go.

969
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:43,750
You can go. I need to talk.

970
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,625
Talk! Talk about what?

971
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:46,958
I don't talk to sidekicks!

972
01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:49,417
Whom did you call a sidekick?

973
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:51,792
Who do you think you are?

974
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:54,125
You've been a trouble-maker
since you got here!

975
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:57,042
He didn't have anything in writing.

976
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:01,375
He made us pack our bags.

977
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:02,792
Sit in buses...

978
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,125
...and then asked us to get off.

979
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,750
ls this a joke?

980
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,167
He was harping about Baghdad.

981
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,458
Where's Baghdad now?

982
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:13,208
Forget it. Let's go.

983
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,125
I won't, you go.

984
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,792
You like being a leader, don't you?

985
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,042
A leader has answers.

986
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,083
Do you have any?

987
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,958
You're a big man...

988
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:33,417
...how would you know
what it feels like...

989
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:34,875
...to have hopes shattered.

990
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,625
Why are you standing
there quietly now?

991
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:41,250
Because he's a big man.

992
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,208
If he was petty like you...

993
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,417
...he'd be talking
as much as you, or more.

994
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:48,875
What do you mean to us?

995
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,875
He cou|d‘ve left with
Simu and me days ago.

996
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:58,917
He still can. But he isn't.

997
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,875
Instead of staying with his family...

998
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,708
...he worries about you all the time.

999
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,292
And at a time like this...

1000
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:10,750
...he left us and went to Baghdad.

1001
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,500
You'd be scared to even
go to the end of the street.

1002
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:18,625
It's easy to point out mistakes,
Mr. George.

1003
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,042
But it takes a lot to
have the courage to make mistakes.

1004
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:23,750
And he has that courage.

1005
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:29,792
You don't. - So who asked him...
to take on our responsibility?

1006
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,250
No one did.

1007
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,042
You're right.

1008
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,250
I even warned him against it.

1009
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:37,083
But what could I do?

1010
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,792
Suddenly he developed a conscience...

1011
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,250
...and realized he
shouldn't be selfish.

1012
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:45,250
He should help others.

1013
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:48,875
Some people have a kind of a...
manufacturing defect.

1014
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,958
They change during tough times.

1015
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:52,750
He changed too.

1016
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,750
You stand here...

1017
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,375
...b|aming him for everything.

1018
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,917
But you don't rea|ise...Mr. George...

1019
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,958
...y0u‘re only standing
here because of him.

1020
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,000
Because he setup this camp.

1021
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,208
Unfortunately, you'll never meet...

1022
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:14,167
...the man that Ranjit Katiyal
was 1O days ago.

1023
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,208
Otherwise...he was an expert...

1024
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:18,000
...in showing a man his place.

1025
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:21,583
You talk about feelings?

1026
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:24,000
I saw his face when he was told...

1027
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,708
...that Tipu Sultan
had been turned back.

1028
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,250
You feel bad for your family...

1029
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,625
Imagine the plight of the man...

1030
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:38,042
...wh0 was hoping to send
thousands of families back home?

1031
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,000
Any more problems?

1032
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,167
Should I go on?

1033
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,417
Please, take him inside.

1034
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:10,667
I've already told him...

1035
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,625
...Mr. Kohli is back
with the Kuwait issue.

1036
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,750
The Minister hasn't
been answering the phone since.

1037
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,292
It looks like he won't go home today.

1038
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,333
ljust need to talk to him.

1039
01:20:23,292 --> 01:20:27,083
I don't get it.
You're not even in the Gulf Division.

1040
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,250
Everyone else is preparing
to leave for the Malaysia conference.

1041
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:34,792
And you're sitting here.

1042
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:38,375
Lata, those people are in trouble.

1043
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,875
There's a guy who calls me everyday.

1044
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,458
What do I say to him?

1045
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:50,250
I told you that the
Minister will support the PWD.

1046
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,292
Yes, sir.

1047
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,042
Has Kohli left or is he still there?

1048
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,917
I think he's gone.
- Good riddance.

1049
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,417
You come in.
- Here I am, sir.

1050
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:09,042
Sorry, sir.

1051
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:12,375
lknocked,
but you were on the intercom..

1052
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:15,750
Kohli, stop acting like
you're scared of me. - Sir.

1053
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:18,167
Kuwait is not our priority.

1054
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,417
Sir, I have only one request..

1055
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:24,792
You know our government is not stable.

1056
01:21:24,917 --> 01:21:27,750
There's no guarantee
how long we'll stay in power.

1057
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:30,208
Of course not sir..
- But you bureaucrats...

1058
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:32,208
...are here until your retirement.

1059
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:35,667
And something will happen
only if you want it to.

1060
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:38,917
You're right, sir.

1061
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:42,958
I've been waiting for
four hours to say exactly this.

1062
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,250
It's been four hours?

1063
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,458
Fine...

1064
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,500
...you guys handle it.

1065
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,167
Hello.

1066
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:06,000
Yes, hold on Kurien.

1067
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:08,625
Ranjit, it's Kurien.

1068
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:15,583
Hello. Yes.

1069
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:20,958
Fine. That's good.

1070
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:22,083
Fine.

1071
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,042
What happened?

1072
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:24,792
They're running out
of food in the camp.

1073
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:25,958
So what are they doing?

1074
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:28,792
Kurien sent Ibrahim to the docks.

1075
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,292
There's some holding shed...

1076
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:32,708
...where they used to buy
stuff for the supermarket.

1077
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:34,917
He saw some activity there.

1078
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,500
Now?
- S0 Kurien's going there.

1079
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,375
He might find something.

1080
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,750
Shouldn't you be going?

1081
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:44,375
Why? Are you feeling
like yelling at George again?

1082
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,458
I go there, return empty handed...

1083
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,792
...George blames me,
and you yell at him

1084
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,625
And we get entertained in Kuwait.

1085
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,500
Come on, Ranjit.

1086
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,042
Ranjit.

1087
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,875
You're a negotiator, baby.

1088
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:08,583
They can't get what you can.

1089
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,500
What if I fail?

1090
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:14,667
You won't.

1091
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:16,917
You won't.

1092
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,625
Its not in your DNA

1093
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,500
It's definitely not a supply ship.

1094
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,042
Seems like they're
preparing to leave though

1095
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:39,583
Let's go take a look.

1096
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:52,417
Excuse me...are you Indian?

1097
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:55,958
Yes. Why?

1098
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,750
No..... Is this ship going anywhere?

1099
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:05,292
Yes...is there a problem?

1100
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,667
No, I... Are they letting you out?

1101
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:10,542
We're taking garbage

1102
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:13,125
Garbage?

1103
01:24:13,292 --> 01:24:16,792
Hey fatso... Come here.

1104
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:22,667
who cares about
garbage in the middle of a war?

1105
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:25,750
I do. I am the captain of this ship.

1106
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,750
Our company has a contract for this.

1107
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,875
Anything else?

1108
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:32,250
Captain, how many people
can get on this ship?

1109
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:35,375
Around 500

1110
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:37,292
But don't even think about it.

1111
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:39,083
Can you think about it if I pay you?

1112
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:47,958
Hey... Leave.

1113
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,958
Quickly. Double-march.

1114
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,333
I can.

1115
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:02,792
But not a single Kuwaiti.
- Of course.

1116
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,458
how much for a single person.

1117
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,708
5000 dollar.
- Hey...

1118
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:13,000
Who pays 5000 dollars for garbage?

1119
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:15,958
I can dump garbage in
the middle of the sea.

1120
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:17,750
Not you.

1121
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:23,042
Who do I have to take?
- What do you care about names?

1122
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:25,167
I can pay you 200 dollars per person.

1123
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,917
Why would I risk
my life for 200 dollars?

1124
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,333
You can for 100,000 dollars?

1125
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:38,208
200 dollars per person. 500 people

1126
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:39,750
100,000 dollars

1127
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:42,875
It's a two hours journey
The money will be all yours.

1128
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,083
Let's go, Kurien.

1129
01:25:48,792 --> 01:25:50,750
Don't look back,
keep walking straight.

1130
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:52,750
Look straight...
- Wait a minute.

1131
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,708
Fine.

1132
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,958
But they won't be my responsibility.

1133
01:25:58,625 --> 01:25:59,250
Okay?

1134
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,208
Get the money and
the people at midnight.

1135
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:04,750
But not a single Kuwaiti.

1136
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:08,958
Poonawala.

1137
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,292
The Sheikhs are having a meeting.

1138
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:21,750
They didn't invite us.

1139
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,208
Wherever the ship takes you...

1140
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:27,625
...you call Red Cross
and claim refugee status.

1141
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,042
I've spoken to the captain.

1142
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:33,000
lt will be 200 dollars per person.

1143
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:36,333
You can all afford it.

1144
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:39,292
I personally feel,
it's a risk worth taking.

1145
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:43,292
This is the army tank,
these are guns and this is the Police.

1146
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:45,500
Baby, WhY?

1147
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,917
Amrita, Simmu isn't ready yet?

1148
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:51,750
You haven't packed either.

1149
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,792
Why pack when we
aren't going anywhere?

1150
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:56,042
Papa, give me my book.

1151
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,000
Give it back.

1152
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,000
Don't be childish.

1153
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,750
I think you've forgotten Punjabi.

1154
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,542
<i>"|'||</i> go wherever my husband goes."

1155
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:10,875
Don't force me, Ranjit.

1156
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:13,417
I'm not going anywhere without you.

1157
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:15,250
And like you said...

1158
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:18,000
Our fate is entwined
with the fate of the others

1159
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,625
Why don't you just admit
that your real problem is the garbage.

1160
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,042
Hello.

1161
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,542
Sanjeev Kohli, Mr. Katiyal.

1162
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:41,375
You've called after quite a while

1163
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,167
Where were you all these days?

1164
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:46,333
We||...| couldn't figure anything out

1165
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,625
But now we're talking to Jordan...

1166
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,583
...t0 let the Indians in Amman.

1167
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,625
Amman?

1168
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,708
Amman is 1000 kilometres from here.

1169
01:27:56,917 --> 01:27:58,750
And we'll have to go through Iraq.

1170
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:01,250
Kohli sir, you can say it so easily.

1171
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,792
But how will we get there?

1172
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,292
You see...this is
the only option we have.

1173
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:10,042
And even that is not confirmed.

1174
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:11,583
Then confirm it

1175
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,417
Because we can't stay here for long,
and that's confirmed

1176
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,917
Another thing Kohli sir.

1177
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:18,750
I'm sending 500 people
on a ship from here.

1178
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:21,958
P|ease...try to get them asylum.

1179
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:23,542
I'll give you the details.

1180
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,000
And don't just stop there.

1181
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:27,042
There are still 150,000 left here.

1182
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,417
Sir...how will we go with them...
- you go with Kurien

1183
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:40,792
Kurien, look after them.

1184
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,708
Don't worry.

1185
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:43,792
Come.

1186
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,167
Ranjit.

1187
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,375
Thank you, buddy.
- Good luck.

1188
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,042
Look after everyone.

1189
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:04,542
Ranjit. What did you say?

1190
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:08,792
First women and children
and then old men.

1191
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:12,333
But here only the rich are going.
- This is really, really unfair Mr. Katiyal.

1192
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,500
Just because we can't give
the money... - Mr. Poonawala...

1193
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:16,000
...| know you don't have money.

1194
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:18,625
And all the people with
you don't have money either.

1195
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:20,750
I d0...but I am not going.

1196
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,417
There's no point in getting
jealous of those who are going.

1197
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,375
And anyway, they're paying a price.
- And us?

1198
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,792
Should we look out for ourselves?
- I didn't say that.

1199
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,000
I am still here with you.

1200
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,958
Joseph, take the bus.
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:39,042
Look, Mr. Ranjit..
- Hey..

1202
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:42,375
Enough...in one moment

1203
01:29:44,917 --> 01:29:45,917
I'll prove Amrita wrong...

1204
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,083
...and go back to
being the old Ranjit...

1205
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:50,083
...which none of you will like.

1206
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,875
I am doing whatever I can.

1207
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:57,500
Don't ask for more.

1208
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:14,417
Heads down. Heads down.

1209
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,375
Spicy Indian food and whiskey.

1210
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:59,042
I know you're a man of your words.

1211
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:04,125
then...why are you cheating?

1212
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:08,333
Cheating?

1213
01:31:09,792 --> 01:31:12,750
You said...| am the Emir now.

1214
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:16,208
Wouldn't I know that...

1215
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:20,750
...you're illegally
sending 500 Indians out?

1216
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:30,792
They can still go...

1217
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:34,792
Just pay the price to the Amir.

1218
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:38,875
I've already have.

1219
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,583
<i>2</i> bottles of whiskey and this.

1220
01:31:47,417 --> 01:31:49,958
I want 100,000 dollars.

1221
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:51,958
I said I was wrong.

1222
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:54,875
You're not the Emir.

1223
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:01,042
If you were the Emir...

1224
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:03,583
...then you would've know about
the deal I made in Baghdad.

1225
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,083
What deal?

1226
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,917
Talk to the External Minister.

1227
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:10,167
Everyone knows...
if the US intervenes...

1228
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:13,167
...|raq will no longer have Kuwait.

1229
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,500
But they will definitely
have the riches looted from Iraq.

1230
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:20,708
All that money
goes to the Swiss Bank.

1231
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:24,958
And your government
has asked me to do this for them.

1232
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:30,208
Call Baghdad and let the bus go.

1233
01:32:30,542 --> 01:32:33,542
Otherwise your President
Mr. Saddam Hussein will

1234
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:34,917
hang you like he did Fawad...

1235
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:40,375
I want 100,000 dollars right now.

1236
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:58,458
May I please speak to Mr. Tariq Aziz

1237
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,542
this is Ranjit Katiyal speaking
- Mr. Ranjit.

1238
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:01,375
Please, stop.

1239
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:04,208
This is not necessary.

1240
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,042
Please, finish dinner.

1241
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,875
I insist Major, please.

1242
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,000
Ranjit,
you never told me about the deal.

1243
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:24,708
There was no deal.

1244
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:27,750
Did you...

1245
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:29,583
I had no other option.

1246
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:31,375
What if he cross-checks?

1247
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:34,750
No one can risk
cross-checking with Saddam.

1248
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:36,792
But that Major

1249
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,667
He'll definitely do something.

1250
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,500
I was just thinking that

1251
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,917
I hope I didn't risk
the lives of 150,000...

1252
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
...in order to save 500.

1253
01:33:59,292 --> 01:34:01,125
Mr. Katiyal, at this hour?

1254
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,625
Mr. Kohli, I am leaving
for Jordan in the morning...

1255
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:03,792
...a|ong with my people.

1256
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:04,708
Jordan?

1257
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:06,417
What happened?

1258
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,083
I never trusted the Iraqi army.

1259
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:10,917
The situation here is getting worse.

1260
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:13,333
But you can't go to Jordan just yet.

1261
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,125
Look...we just started
negotiating with them...

1262
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:18,667
...and they haven't
made a decision yet.

1263
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,708
Then get a decision taken, Mr. Kohli.

1264
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:22,292
We don't have an option.

1265
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:25,333
Trying to get there with
so many people is dangerous.

1266
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:28,083
Staying is
Kuwait is even more dangerous.

1267
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,458
Give me a few days.

1268
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:33,417
I'm talking to the
Civil Aviation ministry...

1269
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,583
Mr. Kohli, please hurry up.

1270
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:38,167
Get the Jordan border to open for us.

1271
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:40,042
Because we're leaving.

1272
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:41,583
Goodnight.

1273
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:57,458
Hello.

1274
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,167
Can I talk to Amrit Pal?

1275
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:03,625
I know it's late,
but it's very urgent.

1276
01:35:03,833 --> 01:35:06,042
This is Kuwait and this is Jordan.

1277
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:11,125
The distance from here
to here is 1091 kilometres.

1278
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:13,750
And for that I need all your help.

1279
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,417
Take as many men as you can.

1280
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,292
Ahmed, here you go.

1281
01:35:57,792 --> 01:36:00,708
Why can't I come?
- Why don't you understand?

1282
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:02,542
We're doing this for a reason.

1283
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:04,167
Mr. Poonawala, you get on that bus.

1284
01:36:04,292 --> 01:36:06,250
Meher, go with your dad.

1285
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:08,292
Joseph, tell everyone...

1286
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:11,042
...that everyone leaves in
groups of 3-4 vehicles. - Okay.

1287
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:12,708
And we all meet at Jahra border.
- Okay.

1288
01:36:12,792 --> 01:36:14,458
And from there we go together.
- Okay, sir.

1289
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:17,583
Did you make sure some young men

1290
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:19,292
are in each vehicle
- Yes...| did.

1291
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:20,333
Okay.

1292
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:21,958
Where's Ibrahim.

1293
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:23,708
Sir, I don't know.

1294
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,250
Ok don't worry about it.

1295
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:38,792
S0 now you're making
a fuss instead of George.

1296
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,083
Sir, I won't go.

1297
01:36:45,417 --> 01:36:47,208
Not without Shazin.

1298
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:49,667
It's not right for me to go.

1299
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:52,000
I'll stay here, and look for her.

1300
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:55,625
If you want to find
her then move ahead.

1301
01:36:56,667 --> 01:36:58,625
By staying here you're proving...

1302
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:01,583
...that you've lost
all hope to see her.

1303
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:04,583
Try to look for her where
all Indians are going.

1304
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:06,250
Maybe...

1305
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:22,708
Good thing we are going from here.

1306
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:25,083
God knows what it will be like there.

1307
01:37:25,292 --> 01:37:28,042
Whatever it is,
it will be better than here.

1308
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,708
What did she say?
- What?

1309
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:39,042
She's your sponsor, right?

1310
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:40,917
Sponsor...
- She's a Kuwaiti?

1311
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:43,500
You worked for her, didn't you?

1312
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:44,333
N0, sir...

1313
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:45,958
Why are you getting involved?

1314
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:49,208
He's the kid, not me.

1315
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:51,042
She spoke in Arabic.

1316
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:52,958
You're a Kuwaiti, aren't you?

1317
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:54,167
I'm telling you...

1318
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:55,625
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1319
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:57,708
George sir.

1320
01:37:57,792 --> 01:37:58,917
Where are you going?

1321
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,583
Why did you get off the bus now?

1322
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:04,125
You need me to get something
in writing from Saddam?

1323
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,333
You weren't able to,
but I found out.

1324
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:09,792
A time-bomb is ticking
in the bus. - What?

1325
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:13,292
The woman travelling with Preethi,
she's a Kuwaiti.

1326
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,042
I know that.
- You know.

1327
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:19,667
And yet you let her stay in the camp.

1328
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,417
If the Iraqi army would have found out...

1329
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,333
...they would've cut
us all to pieces that day. .

1330
01:38:23,458 --> 01:38:25,167
They didn't find out,
you're still alive, aren't you?

1331
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:26,167
Let's go.

1332
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,125
ls this a joke, Mr. Ranjit?

1333
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:32,333
If the Iraqi army finds out...

1334
01:38:32,417 --> 01:38:36,458
...that we're taking
a Kuwaiti in our bus...

1335
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,958
...then our lives will be in danger.

1336
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:42,000
Leave a woman and
a child behind to die...

1337
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,292
...0n|y because she's a Kuwaiti?

1338
01:38:46,917 --> 01:38:48,792
I can't do that, George.

1339
01:38:49,792 --> 01:38:50,708
What?

1340
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:54,417
That Kuwaiti life is important to you,

1341
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,958
...not ours?

1342
01:38:57,875 --> 01:39:00,625
You have no right to do this.

1343
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:02,292
This is wrong.

1344
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:10,250
Ranjit.

1345
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,042
Ask her to come out.
- Sir.

1346
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,125
Tell her to come out.
- Sir, where will she go?

1347
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:21,042
You come out first.

1348
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:22,042
Come out.

1349
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,458
Come out.

1350
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,958
Give me the kid.

1351
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:27,833
Sir.

1352
01:39:27,917 --> 01:39:29,167
Come.

1353
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:31,750
Sir, please.

1354
01:39:33,292 --> 01:39:34,583
Sir...
- Come on.

1355
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:36,292
Let's go.
- Sir.

1356
01:39:37,917 --> 01:39:39,333
Come on.

1357
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,708
Get down.

1358
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:54,667
D0 I have the right to risk my life...

1359
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:57,667
Or should I get that in writing too?

1360
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:02,458
Get into the bus.

1361
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:21,500
She's Tasneem.
She'll be going with us to Amman.

1362
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:22,917
She's a Kuwaiti.

1363
01:40:24,042 --> 01:40:25,875
You can come with us, in our car.

1364
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:32,500
"The desire of my eyes..."

1365
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:38,625
"...is to keep staring at your face."

1366
01:40:39,542 --> 01:40:44,708
"My slumbers are fi||ed..."

1367
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:50,208
"...with only your dreams."

1368
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:53,750
"They all lead me to you..."

1369
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:56,708
"...a|| the paths in the world."

1370
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:59,875
"| love you so much."

1371
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:04,167
"You cannot imagine."

1372
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,833
G0 meet Mr. Tripathi, okay.

1373
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,250
Kohli, we've forwarded the proposal.

1374
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:44,167
And we're talking
to the Air-Force chief.

1375
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:45,583
We'll have to Airlift them.

1376
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:49,167
But sir, 170,000 people
in Air-Force planes?

1377
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,708
I know it's not possible.
- So then?

1378
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:56,917
The Air India Chief has
been summoned in the morning.

1379
01:42:57,708 --> 01:42:59,750
Air India planes can do it,
can't they?

1380
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:02,458
But, sir...civi|ian
aircraft in a war zone?

1381
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,250
That's crazy.

1382
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:13,875
Two dates.

1383
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:16,167
Are we breaking a fast or eating a meal?

1384
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:17,708
I'll take it if he doesn't want it.

1385
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:21,958
Here you go.

1386
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:24,292
No, mom, no dates.
Something else.

1387
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,708
Baby, eat this now.

1388
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:28,917
We'll eat 'ja|ebis'
when we get to India, okay.

1389
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:30,458
Good girl.

1390
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:38,250
You must help us with the evacuation.

1391
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:42,208
We're commercial pilots, sir.
Not the Indian Air Force.

1392
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:44,458
Look, we already had a
word with the Air India chief.

1393
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:45,250
$0?

1394
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:47,500
We have to fly planes
Into a war zone, not him

1395
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:48,292
Yes.

1396
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:50,792
And if we wanted to risk our lives...

1397
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,833
...then we would've
joined the Air Force.

1398
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:55,250
Why don't you volunteer
to fly the plane?

1399
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,125
Sir, can I talk to them.

1400
01:44:03,125 --> 01:44:05,458
Look, there's no
question of forcing you.

1401
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,875
It's your choice
whether you go or not.

1402
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:12,542
But 175,000 people are
waiting for us in Jordan.

1403
01:44:14,292 --> 01:44:15,542
And their only fault is...

1404
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:17,917
...that they're Indians,
but not our kin.

1405
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:21,917
I can't give you a reason...

1406
01:44:22,042 --> 01:44:23,708
...t0 risk your lives for them.

1407
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:28,000
It's best that you
find one yourselves...

1408
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:29,625
...that would save their lives.

1409
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:55,292
Meher.

1410
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,292
I've seen so much news.

1411
01:45:01,167 --> 01:45:04,875
But never thought that someday
we'll be the news.

1412
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:09,292
"|ndian Refugees in
Kuwait Because of |raq."

1413
01:45:11,375 --> 01:45:13,667
It's so confusing, isn't it?

1414
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:23,708
Oh yes...

1415
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,958
The Minister was asking...

1416
01:45:27,125 --> 01:45:28,750
...who's going to pay for all this?

1417
01:45:30,792 --> 01:45:33,458
I think the Finance Ministry
will have to jump in.

1418
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:37,958
Will you talk to them or should I?

1419
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:39,333
You do it, sir.

1420
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:41,167
You see, they have no documents...

1421
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:44,000
...s0 I'll try and get
temporary passports issued.

1422
01:46:12,083 --> 01:46:13,167
Ranjit.

1423
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:14,750
Ranjit.

1424
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:24,333
Don't get out of the car?

1425
01:46:28,583 --> 01:46:29,667
Officer, Indian.

1426
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:32,292
Indian.
We all Indian.

1427
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,625
We got permission
from President Saddam...

1428
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:36,125
Papers...
- To go to Jordan.

1429
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:37,292
Passport.

1430
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:38,333
Show me the passport.

1431
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:40,833
Don't try to ruin things now.

1432
01:46:40,917 --> 01:46:42,042
Get back.

1433
01:46:42,125 --> 01:46:42,958
Show me the passport.

1434
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:44,167
I don't have passport. No passport.

1435
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:45,250
But we assure you...
- Kuwaiti.

1436
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:46,875
We're all Indian.
- Kuwaiti.

1437
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,333
Kuwaiti.
- N0, no, no...we're not Kuwaiti.

1438
01:46:48,625 --> 01:46:49,500
Stop it. Stop it.

1439
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:52,667
Passport. Passport.
- Stay inside, Amrita.

1440
01:46:58,042 --> 01:47:00,208
Indian. We're Indians, sir.

1441
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:03,625
Two more people.

1442
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:05,042
I want two more passports.
- No, no, no.

1443
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:07,000
They are all Indians.
We don't have passports.

1444
01:47:07,167 --> 01:47:08,167
Kuwaiti?
- No, no, no...

1445
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:09,333
No, Indian.

1446
01:47:09,417 --> 01:47:10,208
Kuwaiti...

1447
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:12,875
We're Indian. Indian.
- Kuwaiti. - No, Indian.

1448
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:15,250
Indian.

1449
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:20,708
Dollar. Money.
- You take your money, I take your wife.

1450
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:23,750
She's a Kuwaiti.
Let my boys have some fun.

1451
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:14,125
Ranjit.

1452
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:16,750
Stop it. Leave me.

1453
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:18,042
Ranjit.

1454
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:19,250
Ranjit.

1455
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:21,208
Ranjit.

1456
01:48:22,958 --> 01:48:23,792
Help!

1457
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:27,792
Please, n0...

1458
01:48:28,208 --> 01:48:32,375
Please, don't.
Please.

1459
01:48:59,125 --> 01:49:03,167
Drop your gun...and you all can live.

1460
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:41,667
N0, no, n0...it can't be
done at your level, Mr. Kohli.

1461
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:44,500
Why are you arguing, Mr. Chapekar?

1462
01:49:45,208 --> 01:49:48,458
I told you that the Minister
from Kuwait division...

1463
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:51,583
Mr. Kohli, without confirming
at the secretary level...

1464
01:49:51,667 --> 01:49:54,792
...at the Amman embassy,
we can't issue temporary passports.

1465
01:49:54,875 --> 01:49:55,917
Please try and understand.

1466
01:49:56,042 --> 01:49:57,208
Let people come in...

1467
01:49:57,292 --> 01:50:00,667
...and I'll ask the Minister himself
to speak to you.

1468
01:50:21,958 --> 01:50:23,167
What now?

1469
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:24,792
Will he open the gate?

1470
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:26,208
I wonder what will happen.

1471
01:50:36,708 --> 01:50:38,000
Well done Kohli.

1472
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:31,333
Sir...

1473
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:33,042
Sir, what now?

1474
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:34,250
Where are the others?

1475
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:36,292
Some got down with Joseph.

1476
01:51:36,417 --> 01:51:38,250
And the rest are sitting on the buses.

1477
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:42,167
Excuse me. Mr. Katiyal.

1478
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,250
One question..
- Not now.

1479
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:46,250
Mr. Poonawala,
please go sit in the bus.

1480
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:47,750
Not now.
- Ranjit.

1481
01:51:48,417 --> 01:51:49,792
There are flags from all countries...

1482
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,667
...but where's the Indian flag?

1483
01:51:53,042 --> 01:51:55,583
Do one thing, take her.
- Yes.

1484
01:51:55,958 --> 01:51:58,167
Hold my hand, Simu.

1485
01:52:08,458 --> 01:52:10,792
Mr. Kohli, I cou|d've
insisted for written orders...

1486
01:52:10,875 --> 01:52:11,833
But I am not.

1487
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:14,250
Please hold on.

1488
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,458
Hello.

1489
01:52:15,792 --> 01:52:16,708
Yes, Mohan.

1490
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:18,000
Huh?

1491
01:52:19,042 --> 01:52:20,792
They're at the airport.
- They've already arrived...

1492
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,625
...and you're still
stuck in red tape.

1493
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,875
Mr. Kohli.
Will you please keep quiet?

1494
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
P|ease.!

1495
01:52:26,083 --> 01:52:27,000
Hello...

1496
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:28,875
Yeah, I'll do something.

1497
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:30,583
Give me sometime, I'll do something.

1498
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:34,667
Chapekar sir...they are our people.

1499
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:37,500
They've already suffered a lot.

1500
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,333
Please don't make
them suffer any more...

1501
01:52:39,417 --> 01:52:41,083
...by waiting for orders.

1502
01:52:41,292 --> 01:52:42,333
Please.

1503
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:43,917
Excuse me.

1504
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:45,083
Excuse me.

1505
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:49,583
We're around 170,000 Indians...

1506
01:52:49,792 --> 01:52:51,000
who've come from Kuwait.

1507
01:52:51,125 --> 01:52:53,375
And we've no clue what to do.

1508
01:52:53,458 --> 01:52:55,917
Look, all the people
standing outside...

1509
01:52:56,042 --> 01:52:58,250
...are waiting for
the same information.

1510
01:52:58,333 --> 01:52:59,500
You have to wait too, please.

1511
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:00,875
Saddam has barged into our homes...

1512
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:02,417
...and you're asking us to wait.

1513
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,042
Look...n0 point in getting heated up.

1514
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:08,667
I really don't know anything.

1515
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:09,708
Please.

1516
01:53:13,917 --> 01:53:14,833
Hello.

1517
01:53:14,917 --> 01:53:16,042
Yes, from Delhi.

1518
01:53:16,417 --> 01:53:17,333
Yes.

1519
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,083
Yes, sir.

1520
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,292
Okay, sir.

1521
01:53:20,417 --> 01:53:23,125
Okay, sir.
Thank you.

1522
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1523
01:54:04,208 --> 01:54:09,208
"You kept living on..."

1524
01:54:09,917 --> 01:54:16,500
"...and he kept dying for you."

1525
01:54:16,917 --> 01:54:23,792
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

1526
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:31,000
"...he came to your rescue,
leaving everything behind."

1527
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:37,542
"With happiness in your path."

1528
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:44,750
"He's with you at every turn."

1529
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:51,125
"Leaving everything behind."

1530
01:54:53,625 --> 01:54:58,417
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1531
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:05,333
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1532
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:39,292
Next.

1533
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:40,833
Behram Poonawala.

1534
01:55:44,792 --> 01:55:45,542
Yes, next.

1535
01:55:45,625 --> 01:55:47,625
Meher Poonawala.
- Daljit Singh.

1536
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:52,792
Next.

1537
01:55:53,375 --> 01:55:54,708
Your name?

1538
01:55:56,167 --> 01:55:57,333
Ma‘am, what's your name?

1539
01:55:57,792 --> 01:55:58,708
Shazin.

1540
01:55:59,083 --> 01:56:00,000
Shazin what?

1541
01:56:00,667 --> 01:56:01,833
Shazin. Durrani.

1542
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:04,500
And you?
- Ibrahim Durrani.

1543
01:56:05,042 --> 01:56:06,208
Husband-wife?

1544
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:15,708
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1545
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:22,875
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1546
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:30,000
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1547
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:36,542
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1548
01:56:36,875 --> 01:56:41,875
"The tears that were..."

1549
01:56:50,542 --> 01:56:53,667
"With happiness in your path."

1550
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,375
How did you decide the seating?

1551
01:56:56,875 --> 01:56:59,125
Meaning, who sits in first class...

1552
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:00,500
...and who sits in economy?

1553
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:01,917
Well, I'll just check on that, sir.

1554
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:02,875
Excuse me.

1555
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,542
Otherwise it's very unfair.

1556
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:07,833
Kohli.

1557
01:57:10,333 --> 01:57:11,458
Congratulations.

1558
01:57:11,875 --> 01:57:13,667
The first f|ight's about to take-off.

1559
01:57:25,375 --> 01:57:30,000
"Vande Mataram!"

1560
01:57:32,417 --> 01:57:36,417
"Vande Mataram!"

1561
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:38,833
The World's biggest rescue operation.

1562
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:40,500
Air India, Indian Airlines...

1563
01:57:40,708 --> 01:57:44,250
...and Indian Air Force
pilots flew 488 such flights.

1564
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:47,583
The world has never witnessed nor will
probably ever witness...

1565
01:57:47,917 --> 01:57:50,667
a rescue operation of this scale:

1566
01:57:51,125 --> 01:57:53,667
India brought home, over a 100,000 of
her citizens

1567
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,417
...wh0 were stuck in another country.

1568
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:59,250
And we've brought our
people back safe and sound.

1569
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:03,667
Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

1570
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:05,583
Thank you.
- You did it.

1571
01:58:07,417 --> 01:58:11,625
Those we never met, and never
got the chance to meet later...

1572
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:15,167
Many government officers
like Sanjeev Kohli...

1573
01:58:15,458 --> 01:58:16,750
...made this possible.

1574
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:19,667
Birdy flew.

1575
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,583
Plane flew.

1576
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:24,750
Simu flew.
- N0.

1577
01:58:24,833 --> 01:58:26,000
Mom flew.

1578
01:58:26,375 --> 01:58:28,875
I flew.
How can I fly?

1579
01:58:42,792 --> 01:58:47,500
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1580
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:51,167
Even today I get upset
over some problems in India.

1581
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,625
lam still cynical.

1582
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:55,250
But after boarding that last flight...

1583
01:58:55,708 --> 01:58:59,208
...| have never asked, what
has my country done for me.

1584
01:59:33,125 --> 01:59:38,125
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1585
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:52,250
"You kept living on..."

1586
01:59:53,083 --> 01:59:59,500
"...and he kept dying for you."

1587
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:06,917
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

1588
02:00:07,583 --> 02:00:13,875
"...he came to your rescue,
leaving everything behind."

1589
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:20,958
"With happiness in your path."

1590
02:00:21,583 --> 02:00:27,750
"He's with you at every turn."

1591
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:33,083
"Leaving everything behind."

1592
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:41,750
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1593
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:58,708
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1594
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:06,417
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1595
02:02:06,667 --> 02:02:13,333
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1596
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:19,792
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1597
02:02:20,042 --> 02:02:25,042
"The tears that were..."

1598
02:02:33,708 --> 02:02:40,375
"With happiness in your path."

1599
02:02:41,083 --> 02:02:50,500
How did you decide the seating?

1600
02:02:56,125 --> 02:03:01,125
"The one you forgot...
kept remembering you."

1601
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:44,917
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1602
02:03:45,583 --> 02:03:51,667
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1603
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:59,375
"Each of his moment
passed worrying about you."

1604
02:03:59,667 --> 02:04:05,875
"The world was with you...
while he was all alone."

1605
02:04:05,958 --> 02:04:10,958
"The tears that were..."

1606
02:04:19,583 --> 02:04:26,500
"With happiness in your path."

1607
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:33,417
"He's with you at every turn."

1608
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:37,667
"Leaving everything behind."

1609
02:04:54,375 --> 02:04:59,125
"Vande Mataram!"

1610
02:05:01,458 --> 02:05:04,875
"Vande Mataram!"

1611
02:05:04,958 --> 02:05:08,375
"Vande Mataram!"

1612
02:05:08,458 --> 02:05:12,375
"Vande Mataram!"

1613
02:05:12,458 --> 02:05:15,458
"Vande Mataram!"

1614
02:05:15,542 --> 02:05:20,250
"Vande Mataram!"

1615
02:05:20,667 --> 02:05:24,292
"Vande Mataram!"
