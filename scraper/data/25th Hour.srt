00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:44,734
Sorry, what?

161
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,269
Did you have an appointment
with someone?

162
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,770
Oh, no. No.
I used to go here.

163
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:49,606
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave

164
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,375
And to take the dog
with you.

165
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:53,711
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. We'll just be a minute.

166
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,446
No dogs allowed
on the school grounds.

167
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,414
Okay. Okay.
I understand.

168
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,484
Check this out. Check this out.
Come here. He's all right.

169
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,886
Look at what
a little punk I was.

170
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,960
In the middle
with the ball.

171
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,062
<i>I guess you weren't
the center.</i>

172
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,731
No. No.

173
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,400
I started, though.

174
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,069
Freshman year.
I was on the varsity.
Point guard.

175
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,238
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Still hold the all-time
assist record.

176
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:21,074
Mmh, no. Marvin ray broke
the record last year.

177
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:22,143
He did not.

178
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,177
He did too.

179
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:24,545
Are you sure?

180
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,248
I'm positive.
I coach the girls team.

181
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:35,658
Well...We were
undefeated that year.

182
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:37,761
Then I got kicked off
the team for fighting,

183
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,262
And the whole thing
fell apart.

184
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,864
That's too bad.

185
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:44,001
Hey, listen, you know
where jacob elinsky is?

186
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,137
He's an old friend
of mine.

187
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,010
"now let us sport us
while we may,

188

196
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:17,573
Good.

197
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:21,645
That's good.

198
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,213
That's an excellent reading.

199
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:24,181
[ clears throat ]

200
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,583
What do people think?

201
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,520
What's going on here?

202
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,395
Luke.
Can I go
to the bathroom?

203
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:37,963
No, you went
20 minutes ago.

204
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:41,533
Uh, I have a, um --
a bladder infection.

205
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:42,702
The poem.

206
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,074
<i>"to his coy mistress."</i>

207
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,977
Andrew marvell.

208
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:52,079
Well, it's not real deep
or anything.

209
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,648
The guy wants to get laid,

210
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:54,916
And he's telling her
to give it up.

211
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,485
[ laughter ]

212

213
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,129
Excuse me...
For one minute.

214
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,263
Hey...

215
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:08,865
What's going on?
Hey, who's that?

216
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,199
Look who's here.
It's your buddy.

217
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:11,502
[ chuckles ]

218
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,170
Sorry to --
sorry to drop in on you.

219
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,939
I just wanted to
talk to you for a second.

220
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:16,040
W-what's going on?

221
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,374
Nothing. What --

222
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:18,710
What is this
you got going on here?

223
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:20,445
Teaching my class.
I guess.

224
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:22,380
In a circle like that?
Yeah.

225
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,249
Wow.

226
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,618
That's cool.
I like that.

227
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:26,786
Hey, class.

228
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:27,887
Hey.        Hey.
Hey.                        Hey.

229
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,555
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

230
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,390
Just -- just a little,
slight change of plans.

231
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,660
I got to see
my father tonight,

232
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:37,798
And there's these people --
they're throwing me kind of a...

233
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,800
Going-away party,
right?
Yeah.

234
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:42,503
And, uh, so maybe you and frank
could meet up somewhere.

235
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:44,740
Maybe that place
with the...
Right.

236

Things
that frank goes to.

237
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,577
Yeah.
And I'll find you later?

238
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,712
Okay.

239
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,746
Yeah?
Of course.

240
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,680
All right.

241
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,686
<i>This one's cute
with the red shirt.</i>

242
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:57,688
I think she's giving me
the eye.

243
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,457
How do you do it, man?
I don't know how you do it.
Okay.

244
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,325
[ chuckles ]
so I'll see you later.

245
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:03,128
Yeah, maybe --
maybe like midnight, I think.

246
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,296
Midnight.
Midnight's...

247
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:05,297
Yeah?
Yeah.

248
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,698
Yeah. All right.
Okay.

249
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,600
Come on, buddy.

250
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,736
Have a nice day.

251
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:18,045
Sorry about that.

[ sighs ] oh, christ.

256
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,364
You have a minute?

257
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:08,535
Sure.

258
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:10,705
<i>Yeah, come --
come on in.</i>

259
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:13,507
I thought that no students
were allowed

260
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:15,409
In the teachers' lounge.

261
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:17,279
I won't squeal
on you.

262
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,683
Yeah. Take a seat?

263
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,629
What can I do for you?

264
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,831
<i>I want to know why I got
a b-minus on my paper.</i>

265
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,100
You got what you earned.
Nobody else in that class
can write,

266
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,868
And you know it!
I know it. Everyone knows it.

267
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:39,204
Don't worry about
everyone else.

268
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:40,840
You're not competing
with them.

269
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,842
Yeah, but I am. Okay?
I am competing with them.

270
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,877
When I apply to colleges --
you might have heard of this --

271
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,980
They -- they look at these
things called "grades."

272
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,049
And if your grades aren't
good enough then --

273
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:51,118
No, your grade's
gonna be fine.

274
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,687
Vincent piscella writes a story
about his grandmother dying,

275
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,456
And you give him an a-plus.

I mean, what is that?
A charity a-plus?

280
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,572
I mean,
everyone is always writing

281
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,908
About their grandmothers dying,
and you -- you know -- why?

282
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,077
It's -- it's not because
it's so traumatic.

283
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:16,047
It's because
it's a guaranteed a-plus!

284
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,915
And you're
all sentimental like,

285
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,984
"oh, vince, that was very
powerful, very moving."

286

No, it wasn't.

You didn't care.
I didn't care.

Nobody cared.

Oh.

No.

Why do you care so much?

monty's a fucking drug dealer.

941
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:16,738
Shit.

942
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:20,810
What, are you -- you driving
a vintage super "b"?

943
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:22,779
No.
No. He is.

944
00:47:22,846 --> 00:47:25,949
Yeah, paid for by the misery
of other people.

945
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,587
He got caught.
He's gonna get locked up.

946
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,455
And I'll tell you
something else.

947
00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:33,558
You two are my best friends
in the whole world,

948
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:36,261
And I love him like a brother,
but he fucking deserves it.

949
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,766
He deserves it.

950
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:44,437
What's he planning on doing
with doyle?

951
00:47:44,504 --> 00:47:47,173
How the fuck
should I know?

952
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:50,177
[ chuckles ]

953
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:51,679
I don't know.

954
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:55,617
Maybe...Leave him
with naturelle or something.

955
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:58,454
They should at least let him
take doyle with him.

956
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:01,357
What?

957
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:03,093
Just let him take doyle
with him.

958
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,794
He wouldn't be so lonely.

959
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:08,164
You can't take a fucking dog
to the hoosegow, jake.

960
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:11,302
I'm just saying it'd be
kind of nice if he could.

961
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,504
[ chuckles ]

962
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:15,673
All right.

963
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:17,075
Yeah, it'd be nice.

964
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:27,453
Monty's tough.
I think he'll be okay.

965
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,158
If it were me,
I...I'd never last a day,

966
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:34,728
But...Monty,
he's different.

967
00:48:34,796 --> 00:48:35,996
Oh, yeah?
You believe that?

968
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:37,231
Yeah.

969
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,366
You don't fucking get it,
do you?

970
00:48:39,402 --> 00:48:40,802
What don't I get?

971
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,637
You want the simple
version, jake?

972
00:48:42,705 --> 00:48:45,974
Guys who look like monty don't
do well in prison, all right?

973
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:49,512
Man, he's got three choices,
and none of them are good.

974
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,316
One, he can run.
Two, catch the bullet train.

975
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:55,652
Bullet train?
I'm not saying
what he's gonna do.

976
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,421
I'm saying
what his choices are.

977
00:48:57,522 --> 00:48:59,256
His third choice is he goes
to prison, that's it.

978
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:01,158
Yeah, and that's
what he's gonna do.

979
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:02,594
He'll go and I'll see him
when he gets out.

980
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,264
Maybe.

981
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:09,534
I'll tell you what.

982
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:13,205
After tonight,
it's bye-bye, monty.

983
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:16,943
What does that mean?

984
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:22,349
Man, if he runs, he's gone.
He ain't coming home.

985
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,619
If he pulls the trigger,
they close the casket.

986
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,220
He's gone.

987
00:49:26,288 --> 00:49:29,457
They lock him away, he's gone.
You'll never see him again.

988
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:30,893
I'll see him again.

989
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,561
No, you won't.

990
00:49:32,629 --> 00:49:34,129
No, I'll visit him
up there
oh, bullshit.

991
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,397
And I'll see him
when he gets out.

992
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:36,798
Come on. Don't fuck with --
you know what?

993
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:38,635
This is such horseshit.
This is so much like you, jake.

994
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:39,903
You're not gonna see him --
like me?

995
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,471
Yeah, it's...Exactly.

996
00:49:41,538 --> 00:49:43,606
What's -- why --
you'll never see him again.

997
00:49:43,641 --> 00:49:46,276
You think you're gonna
kick back with some beers,

998
00:49:46,311 --> 00:49:49,313
Reminisce -- old times --
you're still gonna be friends?

999
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:52,484
It's over after tonight, jake.
Wake the fuck up.

1000
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:41,173
[ footsteps approaching ]

1001
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:55,823
Let her go.

1002
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:05,900
That's a good-looking girl
you got there.

1003
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,905
Them spanish broads.
[ chuckles ]

1004
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:11,574
<i>Ooh.
That's a scary look.</i>

1005
00:51:11,675 --> 00:51:12,842
Yikes.

1006
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:16,079
You see the look
he gave me?

1007
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,516
[ chuckles ]

1008
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:23,086
Naturelle riviera --
what a name.

1009
00:51:23,155 --> 00:51:26,524
You see the rack on that girl?
[ exhales deeply ]

1010
00:51:26,592 --> 00:51:28,660
You know what?
Take another angle, man.

1011
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:30,296
You can't fucking touch her.

1012
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:32,798
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1013
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:34,800
You're missing the point.

1014
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:36,469
She touched you.

1015
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:38,004
<i>You're lying.
Am I?</i>

1016
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:40,440
<i>Yeah.
Oh, that's sweet.</i>

1017
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:42,609
You really trust her.
[ chuckles ]

1018
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:44,745
All I know is
she's walking away.

1019
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:46,949
Yeah. We just signed
her release.

1020
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,684
Probably having
a big party tonight

1021
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:51,086
Over at jimmy's bronx cafe.

1022
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,422
<i>Sure. Why not?</i>

1023
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:54,090
Big celebration.

1024
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:58,027
She got that whole fancy
apartment to herself now.

1025
00:51:58,096 --> 00:52:00,698
What? You thought she was
with you for your looks?

1026
00:52:00,765 --> 00:52:03,601
Sh-e-e-e-it.

1027
00:52:03,668 --> 00:52:06,070
Girl saw a pot of honey,
and she licked it clean.

1028
00:52:06,138 --> 00:52:06,972
<i>Yeah.</i>

1029
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:09,941
She's a real smart girl.

1030
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:11,977
Now, you,
on the other hand...

1031
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,980
You're supposed to be smart.

1032
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:18,384
Got yourself a scholarship
to a fancy private school, hmm?

1033
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:20,219
Not bad for a punk
from bay ridge.

1034
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:22,389
Yeah, but then you go
and get yourself thrown out

1035
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:24,491
For dealing weed
to some rich kids.

1036
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,293
What up with that?

1037
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:28,762
You know what happens to
pretty boys like you in prison?

1038
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:29,731
<i>Ooh.</i>

1039
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:31,366
They gonna love you.

1040
00:52:33,669 --> 00:52:35,837
Yeah, maybe.

1041
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,809
But then again...Maybe not.

1042
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:43,445
"jeez, your honor, you know,
what can I say?

1043
00:52:43,514 --> 00:52:45,148
"I messed up.

1044
00:52:45,216 --> 00:52:46,950
"you know, my mother died.

1045
00:52:47,018 --> 00:52:48,518
<i>"I-I was so worried
about my father.</i>

1046
00:52:48,586 --> 00:52:50,253
<i>"I needed to help him out.</i>

1047
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:51,856
<i>"my head was a little
turned around.</i>

1048
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:53,391
"I got hooked in
with the wrong people,

1049
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,092
"and I made a big mistake.

1050
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,397
"I really did,
but...It was my first time.

1051
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:02,234
I'm sorry, and it will never,
ever happen again."

1052
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:08,041
Time served. Probation.

1053
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:11,044
You don't read the papers much,
do you, smart guy?

1054
00:53:11,112 --> 00:53:12,613
In new york,

1055
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,449
We've got a wonderful thing
called the rockefeller laws.

1056
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:17,051
<i>Let me educate you.</i>

1057
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:19,219
<i>You had a kilo in your sofa.</i>

1058
00:53:19,288 --> 00:53:22,390
That kind of weight makes it
an a-1 felony.

1059
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:25,760
15 years to life minimum
for first offense.

1060
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:28,064
Now, with that much spread
in the sentencing guidelines,

1061
00:53:28,131 --> 00:53:30,166
The judges take their cues
from the prosecutors.

1062
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:32,868
So if mr. Prosecutor's wife
busted his chops that morning,

1063
00:53:32,937 --> 00:53:34,037
You're fucked.

1064
00:53:34,105 --> 00:53:35,639
You're gone for good.

1065
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:37,708
If you get lucky --
really lucky --

1066
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:41,044
Now, let's say he got
some good trim the night before.

1067
00:53:41,113 --> 00:53:43,481
<i>Maybe he'll plead you off
to an a-2.</i>

1068
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,619
<i>But that's still three to eight
for first time -- minimum.</i>

1069
00:53:46,686 --> 00:53:48,387
How much of that stretch
you pull

1070
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:50,590
Is all up to the mood
of the prosecutor,

1071
00:53:50,658 --> 00:53:54,094
And he's gonna ask us,
"did he play ball?"

1072
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:58,132
So...

1073
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,836
Why don't you tell us
about your friend nikolai?

1074
00:54:01,903 --> 00:54:03,604
<i>Let us make it easy
on you.</i>

1075
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:07,576
Can I ask you one question?

1076
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,111
[ laughing ] sure.

1077
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,020
When you have your dick
in his mouth,

1078
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,522
Does he just keep talking
like that?

1079
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,294
<i>'cause it seems to me
he just never shuts up,</i>

1080
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:24,962
<i>And I'm --
I'm just curious --</i>

1081
00:54:25,031 --> 00:54:26,731
Does that --
does that get annoying?

1082
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:28,800
You know, you're fucking a guy
in the mouth,

1083
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,136
<i>And he just won't
shut up.
[ laughing ]</i>

1084
00:54:32,973 --> 00:54:35,474
Look here,
you vanilla motherfucker.

1085
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:39,278
<i>When you're upstate
taking it in the culo</i>

1086
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:42,381
By a bunch of guys
calling you shirley,

1087
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,152
You'll only have yourself
and governor rockefeller

1088
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:47,120
To thank for the privilege.

1089
00:54:47,189 --> 00:54:49,624
Let's get the hell out
of here.

1090
00:54:49,658 --> 00:54:53,094
Tell the u.S. Attorney
we got a hard-ass.

1091
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:06,076
You need a girlfriend.

1092
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:08,011
I need a girlfriend?
Yeah.

1093
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,646

<i>"mommy and daddy could turn off
the cash flow one day."</i>

1133

1246
01:00:34,887 --> 01:00:36,688
Yeah. You were in
my brother's class.

1247
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:37,522
Pete.

1248
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:38,489
Mm-hmm.

1249
01:00:38,557 --> 01:00:40,558
Yeah, I know who you are.

1250
01:00:40,626 --> 01:00:43,494
Yo, nat, come on.
Let's go.

1251
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:44,797
We got practice.

1252
01:00:44,864 --> 01:00:45,964
I'll catch up.

1253
01:00:46,032 --> 01:00:47,466
Yeah, all right.

1254
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:48,834
Whatever.

1255
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:50,804
You stupid.

1256
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:52,839
<i>What do you got
practice for?
Basketball.</i>

1257
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:55,342
Seriously? You play?

1258
01:00:55,409 --> 01:00:57,677
Come on.
What are you, a guard?

1259
01:00:57,746 --> 01:00:58,913
Three spot.

1260
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,415
You play small forward?
No shit?

1261
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:04,118
That means you're strong
and quick.

1262
01:01:04,187 --> 01:01:06,688
I play the one -- point.

1263
01:01:06,756 --> 01:01:08,557
You know, you skip too many
of these things,

1264
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:09,925
They'll give you the boot --
for real.

1265
01:01:09,993 --> 01:01:11,393
I just want to finish
my cigarette.

1266
01:01:11,428 --> 01:01:13,529
Funny. You don't --
I don't know.

1267
01:01:13,597 --> 01:01:15,498
I wouldn't have made you
for a ballplayer, you know?

1268
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:17,700
You look more like a...

1269
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:20,436
<i>Like a...A runner,
like a track star.</i>

1270

Where you from?

1271
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:28,246
No, I mean --
you -- you from uptown?

1272
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:30,582
U.F.A.?
You on a scholarship?

1273
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,251
What, I can't be
from riverdale?

1274
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:33,486
You can be
from wherever you want.

1275
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:35,889
Just...Curious.

1276
01:01:38,526 --> 01:01:40,460
I didn't mean nothing.
I was just...

1277
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:42,864
You know, I-I was
on scholarship, too.

1278
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,966
<i>It's a good thing.
You -- you're lucky.</i>

1279
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:48,002
<i>What -- what --
what's your name?</i>

1280
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,071
Nat? Natalie?

1281
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:50,506
<i>Naturelle.
Naturelle?</i>

1282
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,708
Are you serious?

1283
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,044
Naturelle.

1284
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,445
Wow. I like that name.

1285
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:01,918
How old are you?

1286
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:03,887
18.

1287
01:02:03,955 --> 01:02:05,289
Are you 18?

1288
01:02:05,323 --> 01:02:07,658
Why?
'cause it's not every day

1289
01:02:07,759 --> 01:02:09,660
I meet a girl as pretty as you
who plays the three spot.

1290
01:02:09,728 --> 01:02:11,028
That's...That's deadly.

1291
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:15,834
<i>How old are you?
I'm old enough
to have to ask.</i>

1292
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:17,903
You're too old to be
hanging out on the playground.

1293
01:02:17,971 --> 01:02:19,839
[ laughs ]
I wasn't hanging out.

1294
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:22,275
I was...
I was passing by.

1295
01:02:22,343 --> 01:02:24,210
What if I was 17?

1296
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:28,749
It might shorten
the conversation a little.

1297
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:30,184
<i>But you're not.</i>

1298
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:32,086
<i>You're 18,
so we got no problem.</i>

1299
01:02:41,098 --> 01:02:43,499
What do you say I come
and see you play sometime?

1300
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:46,836
Seriously.
I'd like to.

1301
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,607
Maybe.

1302
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:51,842
Maybe?

1303
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:55,012
Okay.

1304
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:56,748
I'll be the one right behind
the bench yelling,

1305
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,950
"get back on 'd'!"

Hey.

01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,965
Come out here
and meet somebody.

Who's that?

You back there?

Hey, baby.
Hey, sweetie.

How you doing?

Hi.
Hi.

1318
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:32,355
Is this your little brother,
frank? He's a cutie.

1319
01:03:32,424 --> 01:03:34,725
Don't bother with me.
I'm in the 62nd percentile.

1320
01:03:34,793 --> 01:03:36,794
Oh. That's probably because
you don't work on wall street.

1321
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:38,829
The scale is skewed
to the money thing.

Everybody knows
about this.
Everybody knows.

Man.

One of the guys

This, uh, biology teacher,
terry --

Mm-hmm.
Did you ever meet terry?

No, I don't think so.

Anyway, he, uh, he --
he really likes this girl.

I don't know.

Uh, she's not
really pretty,

Um...Not in the, uh,
classical sense,

But she...

1341

I don't know. I don't know.
She's -- she's got something.

You know.
Mm-hmm.

And I told him. I...
[ exhales deeply ]

1344

I told terry, you know, to just
forget about it, you know?

1345
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:39,664
He's kind of obsessing,

1346
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:42,535
And it's kind of scary
the way he talks about it.
Yeah.

No, I'm sorry. Were you
