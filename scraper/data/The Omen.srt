1
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,816
The child is dead.

2
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,988
He breathed just for a moment.
Then he breathed no more.

3
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,201
The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead.

4
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,688
I'm afraid it will kill her.

5
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,691
My God, she wanted a baby so much.

6
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,194
For such a long time.

7
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,916
What can I tell her? What will I say?

8
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,594
You could adopt a child.

9
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,811
She wanted her own.

10
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,396
If I may suggest,

11
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,023
it even resembles...

12
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,822
Your wife need never know.

13
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,205
It would be a blessing to her
and to the child.

14
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,591
Are there no relative’s?

15
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,719
None.

16
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,225
The mother died, as your own child,

17
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,813
in the same moment.

18
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,902
You said it could be ours, but...

19
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,406
On this night, Mr. Thorn,

20
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,200
God has given you a son.

21
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,827
Here's your boy.

22
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,497
Good morning. Come va?

23
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,596
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.

24
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,514
What?

25
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:34,893
We can't waste any time. We're leaving
in the morning. Buongiorno, Carlo.

26
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,312
Please, Carlo.

27
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,690
What are you talking about?

28
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:44,903
I am talking about London. I am talking about
the ambassador to the Court of St James.

29
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:49,116
- Well, what about him?
- You're married to him.

30
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,994
I'm what?

31
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,291
It's me. I'm appointed
ambassador to Great Britain.

32
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,996
I've already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.

33
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,123
Well, it's a bit much.

34
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:44,505
Well, nothing's too much for the wife
of the future president of the United States.

35
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,924
You know, you're pushy.

36
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,510
Come on. Wait till you see this.

37
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:55,015
Now this, they call his day room.

38
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,101
His day room.

39
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,399
So? How do you like it so far?

40
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:09,613
- Well, it needs some books. To warm it up.
- Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah.

41
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:48,610
- Something in mind, Mr. Ambassador?
- Why don't we have a little look upstairs?

42
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,823
Well, there's no furniture up there, either.

43
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,416
You know, you could be
too sexy for the White House.

44
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,325
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I won't be long.

45
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,827
We don't have that much to talk about.

46
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,915
Since when did two old college roommates
not have much to talk about?

47
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,294
Since one of them assumed
the awesome burden of the presidency.

48
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,924
- Well, give my regards to the first Lady.
- I'll do my best.

49
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,095
Why don't you change your mind,
fly over with me?

50
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,015
No, I'd better stay here
and fool around with Damien.

51
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,896
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...

52
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,899
Damien?

53
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,329
Oh, my God, Robert.

54
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,124
Damien! Robert, where could he be?

55
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,094
You little monkey.
Don't you ever do that again.

56
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,723
There you are.

57
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,912
- Go.
- Hooray.

58
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,224
- Run out of film?
- Just saving a bit for his canonization.

59
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,394
- How's that?
- He's either the heir to the Thorn millions

60
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,606
- or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?

61
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,624
Go on, Damien. Simile. A big birthday smile.

62
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,711
Come on. smile.

63
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,421
Holly.

64
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,592
- I'll take him, ma'am.
- No, I'll take him.

65
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,011
Come on.

66
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,129
One... two... three...

67
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,424
Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it.

68
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,728
Hold on.

69
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,529
Damien.

70
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,702
Damien, look at me.

71
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,121
I'm over here.

72
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,624
- Damien, I Love you.
- Look. There's Nanny.

73
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,004
Look at me, Damien. It's all for you.

74
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,221
Oh, my God.

75
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,112
Go, Tom.

76
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,521
- Morning. Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven't.

77
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,899
There was an article on the suicide,
your nanny that jumped.

78
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,695
- They say that she Left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.

79
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,698
Mr. Ambassador,
did you know she was on drugs?

80
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,325
Would you mind?

81
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,620
- Mr. Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.

82
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,708
- The article said...
- I don't care what the article said.

83
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm sorry.

84
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:27,217
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?

85
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,307
No, that's all right, Mr. Ambassador.
Let's just say you owe me.

86
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,392
Corporal.

87
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,103
OK, outside.

88
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,612
Yes?

89
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,406
- There's a Father Brennan here to see you.
- Who?

90
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,909
A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.

91
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,621
He says it's a matter of
urgent personal business.

92
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,916
- Never heard of him.
- He says he just needs a minute.

93
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,212
- Something about a hospital.
- Donation time.

94
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:08,217
- All right, send him in.
- I didn't know you were such a soft touch.

95
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,720
On that trip to Saudi Arabia,
why isn't it the right time?

96
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,600
Well, it's personal, Tom. I just
don't feel like leaving home right now.

97
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,907
Yes, Father?

98
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,913
We haven't much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.

99
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,625
All right. What is it?

100
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,422
You must accept Christ as your savior.
You must accept him now.

101
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:54,304
Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you
have a matter of urgent personal business?

102
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:59,518
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.

103
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,730
Only if he is within you
can you defeat the son of the devil.

104
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,400
- I see.
- He's killed once. He'll kill again.

105
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,111
He'll kill until everything that's yours is his.

106
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,115
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.

107
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,492
Accept the Lord Jesus.

108
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,995
Drink his blood.

109
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,915
I've locked the door, Mr. Thorn.

110
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,003
- Yes?
- Would you send for a security guard?

111
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,214
I beg you, Mr. Thorn.
Listen to what I have to say.

112
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,800
Ambassador Thorn?

113
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:36,805
I was at the hospital, Mr. Thorn,
the night your son was born.

114
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,726
- I witnessed the birth.
- Sir?

115
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,313
I beg you.

116
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,693
All right. Stand by.

117
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,702
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr. Thorn.

118
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,497
So Christ will forgive me.

119
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,294
What do you know about my son?

120
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,714
- Everything.
- And what is that?

121
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,512
I saw its mother.

122
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,014
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.

123
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,017
- You're referring to my wife.
- Its mother, Mr. Thorn.

124
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,604
This is blackmail. Come out and say it.
What are you trying to say?

125
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,399
His mother was a jack...

126
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,194
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange. The door was locked.

127
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:36,532
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let's go.

128
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,828
Accept Christ each day.

129
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,913
Drink his blood.

130
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,502
- Just get him off the grounds.
- All right, Father. Come on.

131
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,926
Father.

132
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,512
Thank you.

133
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,697
Come in.

134
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,701
Excuse me. Mrs. Baylock is here.

135
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,621
She says she's the new governess.

136
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,624
Well, that's a start. Show her in.

137
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,128
Come in, please.

138
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,132
- Ambassador and Mrs. Thorn.
- How do you do?

139
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:03,595
I know it's a difficult time for you,
so I'll not intrude on your grief.

140
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,725
I'm here to take away
some of your troubles and anxieties.

141
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,395
We'll soon help your little boy
to forget what's happened.

142
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,398
I'm afraid, sir,
that some of our young nannies,

143
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:18,318
they get homesick,
or they have boyfriend problems.

144
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:23,115
I left all that behind a long time ago.

145
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:27,036
Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy?

146
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,416
Yes, of course. He's upstairs.
I'll show you where it is.

147
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,796
Why don't you just leave us alone at first?
Let us get acquainted in our own way.

148
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:42,217
- Well, he's shy with new people.
- Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be.

149
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,514
- Well, I don't think...
- I think it'll be fine.

150
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,309
Go on. Give it a try.

151
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,021
All right, then.

152
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,565
- Mrs. Horton.
- This way, Mrs. Baylock.

153
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,817
Excuse me.

154
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,911
- I like her.
- She seems all right.

155
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,996
Where'd you find her?

156
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,124
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.

157
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,711
I didn't find her. I assumed you found her.

158
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,218
Round that corner to the right
and it's the door facing you.

159
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,472
- I'll have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.

160
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,894
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

161
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,815
I'm sorry, but we're a little bit confused.

162
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,025
Oh? Why's that?

163
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,488
- Well, we don't know how you got here.
- The agency.

164
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:50,202
- The agency?
- Well, yes. They read in the paper about the...

165
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,624
well, about your first nanny,
so they sent you another.

166
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,920
- That's it.
- I'll call to confirm that.

167
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,510
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.

168
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,766
Well, if I could see your boy, now?

169
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,561
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

170
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,462
Have no fear, little one.

171
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,759
I am here to protect thee.

172
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,485
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.

173
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,285
- Kathy.
- I'm coming. Mrs. Baylock.

174
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,666
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

175
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,168
- Where's Damien?
- If you don't mind,

176
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,671
I think he'd rather go to the park.

177
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,591
- The park? I told you he was going with us.
- He's too young for church.

178
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:31,178
- He'll cause a fuss.
- You don't seem to understand.

179
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,683
It is my wish and my husband's wish
that Damien accompanies us to church.

180
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,769
- Kathy.
- I'll be there in a minute.

181
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,356
Now, please have him dressed at once.

182
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,984
Well, excuse me
for speaking my mind, ma'am,

183
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,570
but do you really think a five-year-old

184
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:53,784
will understand the goings-on
of an Episcopal wedding?

185
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:59,581
Will you have my son dressed and in the car
in five minutes? Thank you very much.

186
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,558
What's the matter, Damien?

187
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,772
It's just a church, that's all.

188
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,359
What's the matter?

189
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,362
- Robert.
- Something wrong?

190
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:15,657
- I don't know. He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?

191
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,870
No, he's just...

192
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,790
No, he's just trembling all over.

193
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,690
- Mr. Ambassador. Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.

194
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,484
- No!
- Damien.

195
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,077
Damien, stop it.

196
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,788
Damien, stop it. Damien.

197
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,873
No!

198
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,292
Horton, drive on.

199
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,895
Are you sure that
you don't wanna call a doctor?

200
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:30,691
No, it's just a couple of bruises.
It'll be all right in the morning.

201
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,485
No, I mean for Damien.

202
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:39,366
Oh, no, he's fine. He's sound asleep.

203
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,494
Just to have him examine him.

204
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,459
Well, he's perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.

205
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:53,589
He never has, has he?
Isn't that a little strange?

206
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,176
Is it?

207
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,679
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.

208
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,183
- Not even a cough or a cold.
- So?

209
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:09,688
I just think it's a little unusual.

210
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,692
Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy.

211
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:20,491
I mean, we have nothing to worry about
with him. Not physically or otherwise.

212
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,874
He just had a bad moment.

213
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,378
You know, like a fright.

214
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,474
Yes?

215
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:50,771
- I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you. Good night.

216
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:56,777
I think the best thing to do with a bad day
like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed.

217
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,279
I'll be along soon.

218
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:40,070
Quiet, now. This is the master of the house.

219
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,989
- What is this?
- Sir?

220
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,366
The dog.

221
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:49,788
- Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?

222
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:54,293
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.

223
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,298
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?

224
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,177
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.

225
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:09,058
As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be
grateful on your long trips away, sir.

226
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:18,359
Mrs. Baylock, we don't need a dog,

227
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:21,362
and if we do, I'll pick him out myself.

228
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:27,659
- Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA,

229
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:32,289
tell them to collect the dog
and find him another home.

230
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,458
You understand?

231
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,878
Sir.

232
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,591
Come on, boy.

233
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:18,168
Welcome to Windsor Safari Park.

234
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,171
Animal compound to your left.

235
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:25,467
Parking, for refreshment and zoo area,
to your right.

236
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:31,682
When driving through animal compounds,
please keep all car windows closed.

237
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:52,494
Thank you.

238
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:29,573
Come on, darling.
Let's go see the monkeys, OK?

239
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:39,166
- Good morning, Horton.
- Good morning, sir.

240
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:21,375
Baboons bite. Keep all car windows closed.

241
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,170
Keep all car windows closed.

242
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:28,674
Baboons are dangerous.

243
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,096
Oh, no.

244
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,680
- All right, Kathy?
- Yeah.

245
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,268
You're so silent this evening.

246
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,563
Just tired, I guess. Sorry.

247
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,483
- Damien all right?
- Yeah.

248
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,568
- You sure?
- Yes.

249
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:24,373
If there were anything wrong,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

250
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:30,879
Wrong? What could be wrong with our child,
Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we?

251
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:34,174
There is something wrong, isn't there?

252
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,263
Kathy.

253
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,390
Is it so serious?

254
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,977
Robert, I want...

255
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:49,898
I need to see a psychiatrist. I have fears.

256
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,401
I have such fears.

257
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:55,571
What kind of fears? What kind?

258
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,490
If I told you, you'd put me away.

259
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:02,494
Kathy, I love you. I love you.

260
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:05,497
Then help me. Find me a doctor.

261
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,292
I will. Of course I will.

262
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:24,183
Keep that scrum tight.
Get down low. Come on.

263
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,896
Let it go. Let it go.

264
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:52,002
Bring him down.

265
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,171
Well done.

266
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:57,466
I don't know what you're clapping for.
You just lost a bet.

267
00:36:57,592 --> 00:37:01,679
- That's right. 27-3?
- Right. That'll be three quid.

268
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:05,599
- I thought it was two.
- Inflation. Haven't you heard, old boy?

269
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,893
Well done, George. Great stuff.

270
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,479
It was a good game.

271
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,690
Go and have a quick drink with the lads.

272
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:16,276
That'll give me time
to make sure everything's set up.

273
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:21,490
Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop's Park.
Five minutes and you'll never see me again.

274
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:25,494
Your wife is in danger.
She'll die unless you come.

275
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,975
Father.

276
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,894
Thanks again.

277
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,996
Get on with it. Say what you have to say.

278
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,879
"When the Jews return to Zion,
and a comet rips the sky,

279
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:46,802
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,
then you and I must die."

280
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:52,266
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore,

281
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:58,188
turning man against his brother,
till man exists no more."

282
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:03,485
- The Book of Revelations predicted it all.
- I'm not here to listen to a sermon.

283
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:07,197
"It is by means of a human personality
entirely in his possession

284
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:10,701
that Satan will wage
his last and formidable offense."

285
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:14,371
- You said that my wife...
- Go to the town of Megiddo

286
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,874
in the old city of Jezreel.

287
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,669
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.

288
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,591
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...

289
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:28,177
"He who will not be saved by the lamb
will be torn by the beast."

290
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:30,304
Will you stop?

291
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:41,398
I'm here because you said
my wife is in danger.

292
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,903
She is pregnant.

293
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:51,283
- You're mistaken. That's nonsense.
- He will not allow the child to be born.

294
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:55,371
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?

295
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,873
Your son, Mr. Thorn.

296
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,501
The son of the devil.

297
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:05,297
He will kill the unborn child,
then he will kill your wife,

298
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:11,887
and when he is certain to inherit all that
is yours, then, Mr. Thorn, he will kill you.

299
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,097
That's enough!

300
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:16,767
With your power, he will establish
his counterfeit kingdom here,

301
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,687
receiving his power directly from Satan.

302
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,774
- You're insane.
- He must die, Mr. Thorn.

303
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,194
You asked for five minutes,
and you've got five minutes.

304
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:32,074
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it's too late.

305
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:35,994
Now, I've heard you.

306
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,872
I want you to hear me.

307
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:42,001
I never want to see you again.

308
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:48,298
You'll see me in hell, Mr. Thorn.

309
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,302
There will we share out our sentence.

310
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:39,094
No!

311
00:44:57,572 --> 00:44:59,573
Mrs. Baylock.

312
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:05,704
- Anything wrong?
- I just can't stand that noise.

313
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:09,667
It's not all that bad.

314
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,378
- Good morning, Damien.
- Good morning, Daddy.

315
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,005
- What are we gonna do?
- Hold my hands.

316
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,174
- Right.
- Mrs. Baylock.

317
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,385
Yes, ma'am?

318
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:23,305
- Would you take him out of here, please?
- He's only playing.

319
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,183
Would you just get him out of here, please?

320
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:30,479
Yes, ma'am.

321
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,277
Come along, Damien. Excuse me, sir.

322
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:49,790
Come along.

323
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:58,382
Darling, I don't know
what's the matter with me. I just...

324
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:01,468
I just don't seem to be able to...

325
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:04,096
I don't know.

326
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:20,487
Kathy, I love you.

327
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:24,867
If this is what the doctor's doing to you,

328
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:28,370
don't you think it's time
I had a talk with him?

329
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,581
Yes, you should.

330
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:34,501
There's something
he wants to talk to you about, anyway.

331
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,670
Oh?

332
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:41,884
Robert, I don't ever
want to have any more children.

333
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:49,975
All right.

334
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:55,481
Then you'll agree to an abortion?

335
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:02,279
I'm pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.

336
00:47:23,885 --> 00:47:26,178
Yes?

337
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:28,389
Yes, this is he.

338
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,182
Who?

339
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:32,393
Who? But...

340
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:38,691
Hello?

341
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:45,906
Something about the newspapers.

342
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:03,507
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.

343
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:09,388
Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons
that won't make her feel inadequate.

344
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:12,099
She has these fantasies.

345
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:17,980
She fantasizes that your child is alien
and that your child is evil.

346
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,691
She thinks that the child is evil?

347
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:25,279
The point is, at this time,
another child would be disastrous.

348
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:30,200
Well, in what way evil?

349
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:34,997
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn't hers.

350
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,599
The most important thing for you to do
is to agree to an abortion.

351
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:55,768
No.

352
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,189
I'd like to know your reason.

353
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:10,074
It was foretold that
this pregnancy would be terminated.

354
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,285
I'm going to fight to see that it's not.

355
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,087
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don't leave.

356
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:25,673
I'm sorry. I must get home.

357
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,781
Damien.

358
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,577
No, no, no, no!

359
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,704
No! No!

360
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:04,206
Are there any developments
on the state of your wife, sir?

361
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:10,796
- How is your wife, Mr. Ambassador?
- Is there any news, sir?

362
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:16,802
- Ambassador Thorn?
- Yes. Doctor?

363
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:19,179
My name is Becker.

364
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,974
Is she all right?

365
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,393
Well, she will recover.

366
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:27,604
She's in there. Bed by the window.

367
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:36,488
She has a concussion
and a broken humerus,

368
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:39,783
and, well, some internal bleeding.

369
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,790
- Internal bleeding?
- Yes.

370
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:51,378
But she's pregnant.

371
00:52:51,504 --> 00:52:52,880
No.

372
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,302
- She's lost it?
- Afraid so.

373
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:11,482
You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for.
She's still alive.

374
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:15,611
And, with proper care,
she can still have children.

375
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:09,373
Robert.

376
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:23,679
Don't let him kill me.

377
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:31,812
Kathy.

378
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:52,207
It's all right.

379
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:49,783
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to bother you, Ambassador Thorn.

380
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:53,412
- Who is this?
- My name is Keith Jennings, sir.

381
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:55,789
The photographer
whose camera got smashed.

382
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:58,709
Would it be possible
to have a word with you at my flat?

383
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:03,589
- If it's about the camera...
- No, it's not about the camera.

384
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:06,592
It's about you, Mr. Thorn.

385
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:09,511
And the death of the priest.

386
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:13,182
Go on.

387
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:21,482
Do you notice anything unusual?

388
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:25,486
No. Sorry.

389
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:30,491
At first I thought
this was just a fault in the film.

390
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:37,289
A strange coincidence.

391
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:47,174
Then it happened again.

392
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:50,803
Interesting, don't you think?

393
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,809
And this, I took on the day
that you were at the rugby match.

394
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,395
- Same thing?
- Only it's more pronounced

395
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:03,107
and it's actually
making contact with the body.

396
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:08,987
The rest, of course - history.

397
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:11,198
I can't explain it.

398
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:21,583
That's why I started digging. The coroner's
report shows that he was riddled with cancer.

399
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,879
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.

400
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:29,591
- He knew that he was dying?
- Apparently, yes.

401
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:35,514
He said that he wanted
to be forgiven by Christ.

402
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:43,605
Externally, his body was normal, except for
one thing on the inside of his right thigh.

403
00:58:43,606 --> 00:58:46,483
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

404
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,987
Six hundred and sixty-six.

405
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,784
- Concentration camp?
- That's what I thought.

406
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:02,207
But the biopsy says it's a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.

407
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:15,596
Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em.

408
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,683
Every inch of wall-space covered,
even the windows.

409
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:25,981
He even needed to be close to his church.

410
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:33,113
There are 47. I counted them.

411
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,284
I think he was trying
to keep something out, don't you?

412
00:59:38,995 --> 00:59:45,084
The police thought he was insane. They let
me come here to see if I could find anything.

413
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:53,008
The first item is a diary.

414
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,889
It didn't say anything about him.

415
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,601
It's about you. What time
you left the house, where you went,

416
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:07,314
what restaurants you had your lunch in,
what time your speaking engagements were.

417
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:12,695
The last entry says that he was supposed to
have met you in Bishop's Park.

418
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:15,489
And that was dated the day he died.

419
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:23,580
The important items are here. If we're to get
to the bottom of this, we've got to start here.

420
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:30,713
This first clipping
is from the Astrologer's Monthly.

421
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:36,802
Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet
changed its shape into a glowing star,

422
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,596
like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.

423
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:45,102
This one was on the other side of the world,
the European continent, five years ago.

424
01:00:46,479 --> 01:00:49,982
6 June, to be exact.

425
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:53,110
Does that date mean anything to you?

426
01:00:53,194 --> 01:00:55,112
Yes.

427
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:58,615
Then you'll recollect this other clipping.

428
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,703
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper.

429
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:06,206
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.

430
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:08,792
The day your son was born.

431
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:12,004
The sixth month, sixth day.

432
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,509
Was your son born at 6am?

433
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:24,683
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark. The three sixes.

434
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:30,814
My son is dead.

435
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:37,488
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

436
01:01:40,283 --> 01:01:44,578
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to help you try and find out.

437
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:48,207
No. It's my problem.

438
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,588
No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too.

439
01:01:58,176 --> 01:02:02,805
When I came here with the police,
I took some photographs.

440
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:07,476
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

441
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:26,412
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

442
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:31,792
Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here.
You'll be perfectly all right.

443
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:39,008
Some all right!

444
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:43,512
- What about Damien?
- I'll speak to Mrs. Horton.

445
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:46,306
She'll look after him.

446
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:53,897
Mrs. Horton?

447
01:02:58,194 --> 01:03:00,696
- Mrs. Baylock.
- Sir.

448
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:03,407
- Where's Mrs. Horton?
- Gone.

449
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:07,995
- Gone out?
- No, they've gone. They just got up and went.

450
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,499
They left an address for you
to send their last month's wages to.

451
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:18,380
Well, didn't Mrs. Horton say anything?
Didn't Horton leave any explanation?

452
01:03:18,506 --> 01:03:21,717
No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage.

453
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:35,481
- I'll look into this when I get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

454
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:37,816
- And Mrs. Baylock?
- Sir?

455
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:41,612
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room.
I clearly told you...

456
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:45,699
He's gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.

457
01:04:24,197 --> 01:04:25,614
No.

458
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:33,080
This is the right address.

459
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:47,177
Apparently, there was a terrible fire
and the old hospital burned down.

460
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,892
Five years ago.

461
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,399
OK.

462
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,497
But surely the fire didn't destroy everything.
There must have been some records.

463
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:20,502
I sorry. I think everything was destroyed.

464
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,714
Isn't it possible
there were some papers stored elsewhere?

465
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:26,091
- I do not know.
- Sister.

466
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:30,012
This is most important to me.

467
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,807
I adopted a child here.
I'm searching for some records of it...

468
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:36,894
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

469
01:05:36,978 --> 01:05:39,980
- No, signore.
- It wasn't an actual adoption.

470
01:05:40,106 --> 01:05:42,608
- You are mistake.
- Wait.

471
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:47,613
Birth records.
If I gave you a date. An exact date.

472
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:51,617
It's no use. The fire started
in the hall of records in the basement.

473
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:54,578
All the paperwork was there.
Went up like a torch.

474
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:57,915
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

475
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:01,877
- The third floor?
- The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes.

476
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:05,381
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?

477
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:08,217
- Surely some survived.
- Sì, some.

478
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:11,178
There was a tall man, a priest.

479
01:06:11,304 --> 01:06:14,098
Dark eyes. Piercing eyes.

480
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:17,685
Yes.

481
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:20,896
- He was principale.
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he...

482
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,190
- Yes, he is alive.
- Is he here?

483
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,483
- No.
- Where?

484
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:28,404
He's in a monastero in Frosinone.

485
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:32,991
Many were taken there. Many die.

486
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:36,704
Perhaps he is die since,
but he lived through the fire.

487
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:40,082
I remember people say it was un miracolo.

488
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,918
Frosinone?

489
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:14,700
- Here we are.
- What is it?

490
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:17,703
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That's the poem.

491
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:20,414
"When the Jews return to Zion..."

492
01:07:20,498 --> 01:07:23,500
And there was something about a comet.

493
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:27,880
Yes, that's here too. "The shower of stars
and the rise of the Roman Empire."

494
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:32,384
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth of the Antichrist.

495
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,595
The devil's child.

496
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:45,814
It's making more sense. The Jews have
returned to Zion and there has been a comet.

497
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:48,108
As for the rise of the Roman Empire,

498
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:52,613
scholars think that could well mean
the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome.

499
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:56,408
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this? In Revelations it says:

500
01:07:56,493 --> 01:08:00,496
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That's the poem again.

501
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:04,416
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore."

502
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:08,003
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted

503
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:11,590
the "eternal sea"
as meaning the world of politics,

504
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:16,178
the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

505
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:22,101
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

506
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:45,916
Looks like this is as far as we go.

507
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:48,085
Let's have a look.

508
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:17,508
Found him?

509
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:41,115
His mind is active,
but since the fire he's not made a sound.

510
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,701
We feed him and take care of his needs.

511
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:47,287
And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

512
01:10:47,414 --> 01:10:48,914
What penance?

513
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:51,917
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep."

514
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:55,087
"May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

515
01:10:55,213 --> 01:10:58,090
He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why?

516
01:10:58,216 --> 01:11:00,300
For abandoning Christ.

517
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:03,512
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

518
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:07,599
- But he doesn't speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.

519
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:10,394
He was able to write it down.

520
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:17,484
You will notice the curved line over the head.

521
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:21,613
This indicates the hood of the monk.
His own hood.

522
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,908
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.

523
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:29,705
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.

524
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:35,586
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

525
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:41,800
For everything holy, there is something
unholy. This is the essence of temptation.

526
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:50,851
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.

527
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:57,691
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.

528
01:11:57,817 --> 01:12:02,154
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them. Now confess to me.

529
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:05,199
- What happened?
- Please, signore.

530
01:12:05,283 --> 01:12:08,744
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?

531
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:13,999
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you, where is she?

532
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,586
Answer me.

533
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:19,088
Answer.

534
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,310
Excuse me.

535
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:28,657
Cervet.

536
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:35,873
Please, does it mean something to you?

537
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,792
Cerveteri.

538
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:41,879
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.

539
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:44,673
Cripta Sant'Angelo.

540
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:49,261
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?

541
01:13:49,387 --> 01:13:52,973
- But there is nothing there. Only graves.
- Where is it?

542
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:58,270
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.

543
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,464
Robert, over here.

544
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:28,063
Maria Scianna.

545
01:17:28,148 --> 01:17:30,274
My God.

546
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:34,361
June 6.

547
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:38,782
Five years ago.

548
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:43,162
Bambino Scianna.

549
01:17:43,246 --> 01:17:45,748
Infant boy. Same date.

550
01:17:53,548 --> 01:17:57,843
"In birth and death,
the generations embrace."

551
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:06,560
Is my son buried here?

552
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:13,650
This woman could be
the mother of the child you adopted.

553
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:18,781
Why here in this terrible place?

554
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:43,764
- No.
- Oh, my God.

555
01:18:56,945 --> 01:19:00,280
- The other one.
- No. Let's get out of here.

556
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:04,243
If it's an animal too,

557
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:08,872
then maybe my child

558
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:13,961
is alive somewhere.

559
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:28,475
They murdered him.

560
01:19:28,476 --> 01:19:32,062
They murdered him as soon as he was born.

561
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:40,863
Murderers.

562
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,544
Come on.

563
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:58,464
Robert.

564
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:15,064
Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves.

565
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:27,951
Run.

566
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:30,871
Robert.

567
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:42,753
- Hello?
- Hello.

568
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:44,963
Kathy?

569
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:49,885
Hello, Robert. Is that you?
I'm so glad you called.

570
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:55,474
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me very carefully.

571
01:22:55,558 --> 01:22:57,685
Do just what I say.

572
01:22:57,852 --> 01:23:01,146
I want you to leave London right now.

573
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:06,485
- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
- I've put through a call to the embassy.

574
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:11,782
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital
and bring you here to Rome.

575
01:23:11,866 --> 01:23:15,661
- Robert, what's happened? What's wrong?
- Please, darling. Just do it.

576
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:18,247
Get ready to leave.

577
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:24,670
- Robert, I don't think I can move very well.
- Kathy, do it.

578
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:30,259
OK. Yes, all right, I'll try to be ready
by the time he gets here.

579
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:32,469
All right, darling.

580
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,386
Who is that? Is that somebody there?

581
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:16,972
Tom? Is that you?

582
01:25:11,569 --> 01:25:13,654
Yes?

583
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:16,573
Yes, this is he.

584
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:22,079
Tom?

585
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:31,755
Kathy?

586
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:40,973
Tom,

587
01:25:42,183 --> 01:25:45,352
I can't talk now.

588
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:42,076
Robert.

589
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:45,954
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

590
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:52,461
It's derived from the word "Armageddon".

591
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:57,174
The end of the world.

592
01:26:57,258 --> 01:27:00,177
It's underground,
about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.

593
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:03,472
There's some excavation going on there.

594
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:08,852
If only you could remember the name
of the man you're supposed to see.

595
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:11,063
It's Bugenhagen.

596
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:14,650
He was an exorcist. I read about him.

597
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,363
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.

598
01:27:20,073 --> 01:27:22,866
"When the Jews return to Zion,

599
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:25,661
and a comet fills the sky

600
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:29,248
and the Holy Roman Empire rises,

601
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:31,875
then you and I must die."

602
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:37,673
"From the eternal sea he rises,

603
01:27:37,757 --> 01:27:40,759
creating armies on either shore

604
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:44,972
turning man against his brother

605
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:50,477
till man exists no more."

606
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:59,153
Kathy is dead.

607
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:04,283
I want Damien to die, too.

608
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:02,383
Hello, Mr. Thorn.

609
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:04,885
I am Bugenhagen.

610
01:29:04,969 --> 01:29:08,972
- What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.

611
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,851
Town of Megiddo.

612
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:18,565
The place where Christianity began.

613
01:29:20,777 --> 01:29:24,363
The little priest - is he dead yet?

614
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:31,954
Yes.

615
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:39,670
Come along, Mr. Thorn.
We had better get to work.

616
01:29:49,472 --> 01:29:51,974
You will excuse us.

617
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:55,853
This is for Mr. Thorn alone.

618
01:29:57,772 --> 01:29:59,773
All right.

619
01:30:53,953 --> 01:30:57,790
It must be done on hallowed ground.

620
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:02,169
A church.

621
01:31:02,253 --> 01:31:05,881
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.

622
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:13,472
This first knife is most important.

623
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:21,980
It extinguishes physical life
and forms the center of the cross.

624
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:28,987
The subsequent placings
extinguish spiritual life

625
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:32,449
and should radiate outward.

626
01:31:32,575 --> 01:31:34,576
Like this.

627
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:43,585
This is not a human child. Make no mistake.

628
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:55,681
- Is there proof?
- Oh, yes.

629
01:31:56,766 --> 01:31:59,184
He bears a birthmark.

630
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:02,980
A sequence of sixes.

631
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:06,984
So, says the Bible,
do all the apostles of Satan.

632
01:32:08,778 --> 01:32:12,072
- He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

633
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:16,160
I've bathed him. I know every inch of him.

634
01:32:17,454 --> 01:32:23,083
If it is not visible on the body,
it will be beneath the hair.

635
01:32:24,961 --> 01:32:27,588
Remove it.

636
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:31,383
You must be devoid of pity.

637
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:38,974
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.

638
01:32:39,059 --> 01:32:42,353
She will die before permitting this.

639
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:56,450
Look, I want to know what he said.
I've a right to know.

640
01:32:56,576 --> 01:33:01,288
Robert, I want to know what he said.
Look, I'm not just some bystander.

641
01:33:01,373 --> 01:33:05,376
- I was the one that found him.
- I'm the one that's supposed to kill him.

642
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:09,380
These are knives. He wants me to stab him.

643
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:12,591
- Wants me to murder a child.
- It's not a child.

644
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:15,469
How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong.

645
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:20,766
It's insane. I won't have anything
to do with murdering a little boy.

646
01:33:20,892 --> 01:33:23,852
He's not responsible. I won't do it.

647
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,863
Well, if you don't do it, I will.

648
01:41:11,071 --> 01:41:13,489
No!

649
01:41:34,094 --> 01:41:36,679
Run, Damien. Run. Run.

650
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:07,376
No!

651
01:44:22,887 --> 01:44:23,887
Hold it.

652
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:31,478
- Panda Four to control.
- MP to Panda Four, come in, please.

653
01:44:31,563 --> 01:44:36,483
Panda Four in pursuit.
American Ambassador, white estate car.

654
01:44:36,568 --> 01:44:39,570
Heading north. Seven Hills Road. Over.

655
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,578
Al. We've got a shout.

656
01:44:47,662 --> 01:44:49,788
I'll be back later, all right?

657
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:55,377
MP to Zulu Seven.
You are requested assist Panda Four

658
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:58,589
in pursuit of white estate car,
north Seven Hills Road.

659
01:44:58,798 --> 01:45:00,674
Possible diplomatic incident.

660
01:45:06,473 --> 01:45:11,393
Zulu Seven to Panda Four.
We have taken over your pursuit. Over.

661
01:45:24,991 --> 01:45:29,161
Zulu Seven to MP.
Heading west on Old Church Road.

662
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:23,966
No! Please, Daddy, no!

663
01:46:24,592 --> 01:46:28,387
- No, Daddy. No!
- God help me.

664
01:46:28,763 --> 01:46:32,057
Police! Drop. Drop, or I'll fire.

665
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:50,993
And so to their final rest do we commit
these two and entrust them unto our Lord.

666
01:46:52,495 --> 01:46:57,583
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

667
01:46:58,376 --> 01:47:00,461
Detail, attention.

668
01:47:01,463 --> 01:47:03,589
Present arms.

669
01:47:07,469 --> 01:47:18,771
Ready, aim, fire.

670
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:19,873
Excuse me, Mr. President. When you're ready
to leave, your car is over there.

671
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,376
- In a moment.
- Yes, sir.
