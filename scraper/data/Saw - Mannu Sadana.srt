1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,718
Help! Someone help me!

2
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,056
Is someone there?

3
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,184
Hey!

4
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,521
Oh, shit, I'm probably dead.

5
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:49,315
You're not dead.
-Who's that?

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,484
Who's that?

7
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,195
There's no point in yelling,
I already tried that.

8
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,531
Turn on the lights!

9
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,825
I would if I could.

10
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:02,202
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?

11
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:05,831
-I don't know yet.
-What is that smell?

12
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:10,085
Shh. Hang on a second.
I think I found something.

13
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:56,779
Holy shit.

14
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,462
Aaaargh! Help!

15
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:17,799
Help!

16
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:21,844
Help!

17
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,413
Help!

18
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,941
No-one can hear you.

19
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,018
What the fuck is this?

20
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,688
Calm down. Just calm down.

21
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:34,981
Are you hurt?

22
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,401
I don't know. Yeah!

23
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,112
-What's your name?
-My name is Very Fucking Confused.

24
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,707
What's your name?
What's going on here?

25
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:49,369
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
I just woke up here, just like you.

26
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,746
Aaaargh!

27
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,774
Recognize him?

28
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,584
No.

29
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,905
Do you have any idea how you got here?

30
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,223
No.

31
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:15,101
-What's the last thing you remember?
-Nothing.

32
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:19,564
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment,
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

33
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,985
What about you, huh?

34
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,372
There's... There's not much to tell.

35
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,859
I was on my way home from work, and...

36
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,903
I don't remember anything else.

37
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,543
First dead body I've ever seen.

38
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,778
They look different in real life.

39
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,949
They don't move.

40
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,064
From the looks of these chains,

41
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:58,817
someone didn't want us
to go very far, either.

42
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,879
- Can you see any scars?
- What?

43
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,699
Ha? This is what they do man,
they kidnap you and drug you...

44
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,619
before you know what, you're lying in a
bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.

45
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,569
No-one has taken your kidneys.

46
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,364
How can you tell from way over there?

47
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:18,084
Because, you'd either be in terrible
agony, or you'd be dead by now.

48
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,144
Trust me.

49
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,387
-What are you, a surgeon?
-Yeah.

50
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:25,707
So...

51
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:29,837
Are you gonna tell me
your name, or what?

52
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,142
Adam.

53
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,553
Well, Adam...

54
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:42,432
What we need to do...

55
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,851
is start thinking about why we're here.

56
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:48,462
Whoever brought us here
could have killed us by now.

57
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,755
But they didn't.

58
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:52,516
They must want something from us.

59
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,778
The question is, what?

60
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,618
-That clock.
-What about it?

61
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:07,663
-It's brand-new.
-So?

62
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,667
So... somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

63
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:18,506
Wait, I think I might be
able to reach the door.

64
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,406
What is that?

65
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,202
Excuse me.

66
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,246
It's a tape.

67
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,248
-Where did you find it?
-It was in my pocket.

68
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,892
It says, "Play me."

69
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,122
Come on. Come on.

70
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,752
Throw it over here.

71
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:52,885
Fuck.

72
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:05,563
No?

73
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:35,091
-Use your shirt.
-What?

74
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:37,218
Your shirt.

75
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,065
Come on.

76
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:00,197
-It won't work.
-Look around.

77
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:02,324
There must be something else you can use.

78
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:06,161
-There's nothing.
-Well, there must be something.

79
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:21,216
Come on. You can do it.

80
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,222
Come on. Come on.

81
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,598
Again.

82
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,546
<i>Rise and shine, Adam.</i>

83
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:56,090
<i>You're probably wondering where you are.</i>

84
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:58,676
<i>I'll tell you where you might be.</i>

85
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:01,554
<i>You might be in the room that you die in.</i>

86
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:07,660
<i>Up until now, you've simply sat in the shadows,
watching others live out their lives.</i>

87
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,038
<i>But what do voyeurs see
when they look into the mirror?</i>

88
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:18,336
<i>Now, I see you as a strange mix
of someone angry yet apathetic.</i>

89
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,420
<i>But mostly just pathetic.</i>

90
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:23,573
<i>So, are you going to watch
yourself die today, Adam,</i>

91
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:25,617
<i>or do something about it?</i>

92
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:28,820
I don't get it.

93
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:30,948
Throw me the player.

94
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:36,360
No. You throw me your tape.

95
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:41,274
Look, we're gonna have to work together,
if we want to get out of here. Now just...

96
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,734
- throw it to me.
- I'm not gonna risk breaking it.

97
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,962
You throw me your tape.

98
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,853
<i>Dr. Gordon...</i>

99
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:07,439
<i>this is your wake-up call.</i>

100
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:11,360
<i>Every day of your working life,
you have given people the news</i>

101
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,820
<i>that they're gonna die soon.</i>

102
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:17,740
<i>Now you will be the cause of death.</i>

103
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:21,128
<i>Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.</i>

104
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,213
<i>You have until 6 on the clock to do it.</i>

105
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,791
<i>There's a man in the room with you.</i>

106
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,460
<i>When there's that much poison in your blood,</i>

107
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:34,131
<i>the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.</i>

108
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:44,557
<i>There are ways to win this,
hidden all around you.</i>

109
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:49,979
<i>Just remember,
X marks the spot for the treasure.</i>

110
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:53,439
<i>If you do not kill Adam by six,</i>

111
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:57,719
<i>then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon.</i>

112
00:11:58,704 --> 00:12:02,040
<i>And I'll leave you in
this room to rot.</i>

113
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,576
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

114
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,944
Give me that.

115
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,654
Now.

116
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:31,708
<i>Then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon...</i>

117
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,228
<i>...and I'll leave you in
this room to rot.</i>

118
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:39,300
-Any idea who that is?
-Let the game begin.

119
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:43,236
-He knows us.
-Wait a minute.

120
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,006
What do you think? Probably a joke, right?

121
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,490
Shh! Shh!

122
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,744
<i>-Let the game begin.
-Listen. Listen.</i>

123
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,830
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

124
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:04,839
What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?

125
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:14,640
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

126
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,235
Come on. Come on.

127
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,949
Oh, man!

128
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:43,583
-Anything?
-No solids.

129
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:45,001
Take off the lid.

130
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:49,171
Come on.

131
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,307
I really wish I had've checked in there first.

132
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,559
Huh! What is it?

133
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:33,713
Hey.

134
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,799
Mind passing me the other one?

135
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,908
Fuck! Fuck!

136
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,951
He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.

137
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,830
He wants us to cut through our feet.

138
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,044
I think I may know who's done this to us.

139
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,546
What did you say?

140
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,673
Well, it's not someone I know personally.

141
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,217
It's just someone I know of.

142
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,762
Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?

143
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,266
Last I heard...

144
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,145
.. the police still hadn't caught him.

145
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,563
And the only reason I know that...

146
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,690
is because I was a suspect.

147
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,153
I'll start from the beginning.

148
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,413
This one's not fresh any more.
At least three weeks out.

149
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:44,750
Victim's a 46-year-old male.

150
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:50,964
Died of massive blood loss,
mostly through the femoral artery.

151
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,096
He started at the back of the cage and
tunneled his way through that razor wire so fast,

152
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,523
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

153
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:06,436
Cut himself so deep, we found
traces of stomach acid on the floor.

154
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,385
We also found this.

155
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:19,484
<i>Hello, Paul. You are a perfectly
healthy, sane, middle-class male,</i>

156
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,185
<i>yet last month,</i>

157
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:23,855
<i>you ran a straight razor across your wrists.</i>

158
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:28,717
<i>Did you cut yourself because
you truly wanted to die, or...</i>

159
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:31,028
<i>..did you just want some attention?</i>

160
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,572
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

161
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:36,617
<i>The irony is that if you want to die,</i>

162
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,602
<i>you just have to stay where you are.</i>

163
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:42,071
<i>But if you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

164
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,625
<i>Find a path through the razor wire to the door.</i>

165
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,259
<i>But hurry.</i>

166
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,829
<i>At three o'clock that door will lock.</i>

167
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,315
<i>And then this room becomes your tomb.</i>

168
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:56,952
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?</i>

169
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,159
Door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until three o'clock.

170
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:08,137
Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.

171
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,132
A jigsaw piece.

172
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:24,330
I think we're gonna be here for a while, Sing.

173
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,926
The newspapers started
calling him "the jigsaw killer".

174
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:31,462
Actually, technically speaking, he's...

175
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,591
...not really a murderer.

176
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:38,000
He never killed anyone.

177
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:41,045
He finds ways for his victims
to kill themselves.

178
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,969
<i>Hello, Mark. If you're so sick,</i>

179
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,481
<i>then why do I have so many photos of you
up and about?</i>

180
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:53,542
<i>Let's put your so-called illness to the test.</i>

181
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:58,456
<i>Right now, there's a slow-acting
poison in your veins.</i>

182
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,425
<i>The antidote is inside the safe.</i>

183
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,052
Help!

184
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,081
<i>The combination to the safe...</i>

185
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,082
<i>...is written on the wall.</i>

186
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:10,133
<i>Hurry up and program it in.</i>

187
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:12,260
<i>But watch your step.</i>

188
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:17,381
<i>By the way, that's a flammable substance
smeared on your body.</i>

189
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:21,076
<i>So, I would be careful
with that candle, if I were you.</i>

190
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:26,832
<i>Or all the people you've burned with your act
just might have their revenge.</i>

191
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,245
Aaaargh!

192
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,456
I found something else.

193
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,684
Well, two things, actually.

194
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,503
There was someone standing outside
here, watching through this peephole.

195
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:46,341
Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.

196
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,919
He was there at the last one as well.

197
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,682
Only, this time... he left us his penlight.

198
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:58,844
Hm...

199
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,914
Get a rush on the prints.

200
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:02,992
Copy that.

201
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:03,993
Okay...

202
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:08,561
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe
tumor extending across the midline.

203
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:11,398
It started as colon cancer.

204
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,118
The patient has come in for a standard checkup,

205
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,246
by which we are able to monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

206
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,948
- The patient had...
- His name is John.

207
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,827
Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person.

208
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,040
Thank you for that information, Zep.

209
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:34,386
As you can see, our orderlies
form very special bonds with the patients.

210
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:37,447
- Continuing on, the patient had...
- Dr. Gordon...

211
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:40,283
<i>Dr Lawrence Gordon,
please page the operator.</i>

212
00:20:41,827 --> 00:20:46,331
Obviously, someone doesn't want me to
tell you what the patient had! Excuse me.

213
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:52,977
Dr. Gordon.

214
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:56,815
I'm Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing.
City homicide.

215
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:01,594
- Very impressive.
- Oh, thank you.

216
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,346
I do my best.

217
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,659
- Sorry to interrupt you while you're working.
- It's Fine.

218
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,885
Now, how can I help you gentlemen?

219
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:16,549
Are you able to tell us where you were between
the hours of 11 PM and 1 AM last night Doctor?

220
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,711
Why is it that you're interested?

221
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,130
We'd like to ask a few questions about it.

222
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:26,967
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

223
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,997
Would you like to follow us there?

224
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,880
I'm afraid that's... that's
quiet out of the question.

225
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:35,958
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus my wife has the car today.

226
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,294
Uh.. That's Okay. You can ride with us.

227
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:40,012
Doc?

228
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:47,327
I'm sorry.

229
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:50,698
You'll have to tell me again.
Wha... What is this all about?

230
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,066
Is this yours, Doctor?

231
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:10,032
So you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

232
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,075
Of course not, Brett.

233
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:18,348
Well, I have to ask.
What were you doing last night?

234
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:23,311
I was seeing someone.

235
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:26,314
Who?

236
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:32,361
Look, if you can't be honest with me...

237
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,488
I was visiting someone, It wasn't a patient.

238
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:36,448
All right?

239
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:40,869
What am I gonna do?

240
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:43,537
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

241
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:48,918
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

242
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,170
cause no one's gonna believe you later.

243
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:58,760
That was five months ago.

244
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,432
He tried to set me up for murder.

245
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:09,937
Okay.

246
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,399
We checked your alibi, It holds up.

247
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:16,652
Good. Can I go home now?

248
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,030
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

249
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:24,492
Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony.

250
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:26,577
Maybe it'll trigger something.

251
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:30,748
-I'd like to help, really, but...
-Well, we'd appreciate it.

252
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,334
-She's the only one who made it.
-OK.

253
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,966
Amanda...

254
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:44,469
In your own time...

255
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:47,221
tell me the first thing you remember.

256
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:03,711
I woke up.

257
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,664
All I could taste was blood...

258
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,117
...and metal.

259
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:40,253
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

260
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:44,441
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

261
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,776
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

262
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,821
<i>Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

263
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,658
<i>The device you're wearing
is hooked into your upper and lower jaws.</i>

264
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,119
<i>When the timer on the back goes off,</i>

265
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,623
<i>your mouth will be permanently ripped open.</i>

266
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,759
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

267
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,961
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

268
00:25:18,948 --> 00:25:22,367
<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

269
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,395
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

270
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:28,698
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

271
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:30,867
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

272
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:33,569
<i>You'd better hurry up.</i>

273
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:35,696
<i>Live or die.</i>

274
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,615
<i>Make your choice.</i>

275
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,633
No!

276
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,152
And then I saw the body.

277
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:42,800
There was a knife.

278
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,958
He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.

279
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:20,986
Couldn't move or feel much of anything.

280
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,715
You mean... he was alive?

281
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,008
Was.

282
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,720
What happened after you took it off?

283
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:31,889
<i>Congratulations. You are still alive.</i>

284
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:36,819
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.</i>

285
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:40,196
<i>But not you. Not any more.</i>

286
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:51,257
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?

287
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:55,953
Do you think that is why he picked you?

288
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:04,860
Are you grateful, Mandy?

289
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:13,461
He... He... helped me.

290
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,539
Are you sure it's him?

291
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:58,460
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-How do I know you're telling the truth?

292
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:01,354
You could be the one who put me in this room!

293
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:05,176
I'm in exactly the same situation you're in.

294
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:09,099
Wrong. Wrong! You've got one thing I don't.

295
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,026
Information. You know who did this.

296
00:30:13,092 --> 00:30:16,436
Now, you either tell me what is really
going on, or I'll cut you with this!

297
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:18,480
You hear me, I'll cu...

298
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,051
-What?
-It's a two-way mirror.

299
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:00,235
I can see you.

300
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:03,904
So, that's what this is. Reality TV.

301
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,615
Don't look at me, I can't help you.

302
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:10,452
Can you hear me in there? Huh?
I'm having a blast.

303
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,830
This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.

304
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,749
Make sure you're getting everything.

305
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,129
That's not gonna do anything.

306
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,882
-You want to leave it running on us?
-You won't stop it.

307
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:30,262
That's why we can't cut through these chains
or why you won't break that glass.

308
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,598
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

309
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,560
You make it sound like you admire this prick.

310
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:40,396
To overcome something, you have to
understand what a perfect engine it is.

311
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,189
That's how you fight disease.

312
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:46,694
The tape told us to find an X.

313
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:50,281
That X has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.

314
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:53,741
How can you be the calm doctor when
your wife and kid are out there?

315
00:31:53,826 --> 00:31:56,536
He has them too.
He could be doing anything to them now.

316
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,832
-Are you thinking about that?
-I am thinking about that.

317
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:10,591
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

318
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:56,271
Diana, honey, are you OK?

319
00:33:58,315 --> 00:34:00,608
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

320
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:04,112
-Mommy...
-What is it, sweet pea?

321
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:06,823
There's a man in my room.

322
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:10,493
Oh, honey, are you sure he's not
just hiding in your imagination?

323
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,620
He talked to me.

324
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:16,998
OK, I'll come and check your room.

325
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,127
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

326
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:24,840
All right, if you want. Come on.

327
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:32,138
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

328
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:33,639
Just a minute.

329
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:37,101
She wants you to check her room.

330
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,644
Mm-hm. Just got to finish this paragraph.

331
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:46,192
Come on, sweetie, I'll check with you.

332
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,363
Nope, I'm done.

333
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,367
See? There's no-one in your room.

334
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:59,746
There's no such thing as the Bad Man.

335
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,667
-Now can you go to sleep?
-I'm still scared.

336
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,043
You are? Give me your tootsie.

337
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:10,506
Oh, what a big tootsie.

338
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:12,800
Remember this one?

339
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:15,094
This little piggy went to market.

340
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,430
This little piggy stayed home.

341
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:19,723
This little piggy had roast beef.

342
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:21,933
This little piggy had none.

343
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:24,144
This little piggy ran...

344
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:27,147
Whee! All the way home!

345
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,650
I hate that thing.

346
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:35,112
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

347
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:37,948
You know what Daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

348
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:40,951
Let's see.

349
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:44,245
Try and get some sleep, now, OK?

350
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:54,088
You're not gonna leave us, are you, Daddy?

351
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:57,799
What?

352
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:00,969
What are you talking about?

353
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:03,889
You mean, leave you and Mommy?

354
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:08,352
No. No, sweetheart, I...

355
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,478
I would never do that.

356
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:14,732
-Who gave you that idea?
-No-one.

357
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:18,402
Well, it's not true. OK?

358
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,698
-OK.
-How much do I love you?

359
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:25,742
-Love you very much.
-That's right. That's right.

360
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:29,871
-Good night, sweetie.
-Good night, Daddy.

361
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,836
Tomorrow... I'll read you your favorite story.

362
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,380
OK.

363
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:42,299
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

364
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:45,469
-What are you talking about?
-How can you pretend you're happy?

365
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:48,847
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

366
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,224
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

367
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:53,726
At least there would be some passion in it.

368
00:36:57,856 --> 00:36:59,899
Would you like to see her?

369
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,959
-She's beautiful.
-Thank you.

370
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,337
You gonna have any more kids?

371
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:26,424
Ah, we've... talked about it, but er...

372
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:30,677
.. with our schedules,

373
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:33,304
it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.

374
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:37,142
So, where's the lucky wife?

375
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:40,478
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

376
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:45,065
It's my favorite one because...
we're all in it together.

377
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,694
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera,

378
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:51,822
which means I'm always missing
from the photos.

379
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:11,131
It's er... It's not here.

380
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:12,883
What?

381
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:16,344
This photo you're talking about's not here.

382
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,554
Really? Are you sure?

383
00:38:18,638 --> 00:38:20,681
Yeah. Just...

384
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,071
Why, he... he must have taken it, I...

385
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,157
How can you pretend you're happy?

386
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:43,036
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

387
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,120
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

388
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:47,247
At least there would be some passion in it.

389
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,336
We'll talk about this later. OK?

390
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,382
Just leave.

391
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:34,124
Good night, little girl.

392
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,339
Diana?

393
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:44,717
Diana?

394
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,513
Diana!

395
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,316
Mommy!

396
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,780
Shh.

397
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,675
Don't you dare!

398
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,760
Get away from her!

399
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:41,978
Mommy!

400
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,071
Mommy!

401
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:56,450
Mommy! Mommy!

402
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:59,286
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!

403
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,371
Get off of her!

404
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:32,150
Oh, you little man! I see you.

405
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:39,072
Does Dr. Gordon know
you're at home with his wife?

406
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:43,911
I know you know something.

407
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,293
What are you doing in there?

408
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:56,214
Waiting for the doctor?
I'm waiting for the doctor, too.

409
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:00,133
Huh!

410
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:10,727
I never should have let you go.

411
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:23,364
There was someone
standing outside here watching.

412
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:25,281
I want to play a game.

413
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:30,495
Jigsaw piece.
We're gonna be here for a while. Sing.

414
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,622
Hello, Amanda.

415
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:38,752
Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us
where were you last night?

416
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:42,839
You have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

417
00:42:42,924 --> 00:42:45,717
-We checked your alibi, it holds up.
-Isn't that right?

418
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:47,928
I never should have let you go.

419
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:54,976
Here we are.

420
00:42:56,103 --> 00:42:58,020
That was er...

421
00:42:58,105 --> 00:43:00,523
quite an amazing story that poor woman told.

422
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:17,454
Look, I'm...

423
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,251
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

424
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:26,880
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

425
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:29,132
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

426
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,968
He lived two blocks from here.

427
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:38,016
The sewer lines run under this neighborhood,
too... Doctor.

428
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:05,082
Hello, Amanda.

429
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:08,918
You don't know me, but I know you.

430
00:44:09,003 --> 00:44:13,214
I want to play a game.
Here's what happens if you lose.

431
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:19,429
There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.

432
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:21,597
When the timer goes off...

433
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:28,896
-I'll catch you guys down there.
-... like a reverse bear trap.

434
00:44:34,693 --> 00:44:36,277
I'll show you.

435
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:42,950
-Hey, Tapp.
-Hmm?

436
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:46,245
We're gonna go down to get a beer.
You want to come?

437
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:48,121
I don't think so. But thanks, anyway.

438
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:50,999
Well, you know, I always ask.

439
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,627
-There is one key to open the device.
-Have fun.

440
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:57,214
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

441
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,716
Hey, Tapp.
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

442
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:05,346
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.

443
00:45:08,058 --> 00:45:12,186
It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
Look around...

444
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:18,149
Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.

445
00:45:19,276 --> 00:45:21,319
You'd better hurry up.

446
00:45:23,446 --> 00:45:25,489
Wait, wait, wait. Sing.

447
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:29,868
-Get back here.
-What?

448
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:39,252
What?

449
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:45,258
Remember 118th Street?

450
00:45:47,886 --> 00:45:52,723
Er... K2K. That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

451
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,849
Now, listen to this.

452
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:13,158
Check the records for all fire emergencies
in that area within the last two weeks.

453
00:46:13,243 --> 00:46:14,576
Go -right now.

454
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,743
Mmm!

455
00:46:15,828 --> 00:46:21,457
On Tuesday 17th, a fire alarm went off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

456
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:25,545
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

457
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:27,672
Think we have enough for a warrant, though?

458
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:29,798
Who said anything about a warrant?

459
00:46:29,882 --> 00:46:31,299
Right now?

460
00:46:31,384 --> 00:46:33,135
Why not?

461
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,886
Yeah, why not?

462
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,898
At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

463
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:50,317
Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

464
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:38,570
I got you.

465
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,411
What the hell is this?

466
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,137
Shit.

467
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,940
Oh, fuck!

468
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,914
Wait, Sing. Let's see what he's gonna do.

469
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:24,042
-Why? We fuckin' got him.
-We don't know what he looks like.

470
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,920
-Let's see what he's gonna do.
-No fucking way.

471
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,797
Fuck that, I'm gonna take him.

472
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,965
What the fuck? Shit!

473
00:50:16,425 --> 00:50:20,136
Awake already, Jeff?

474
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:23,472
I need more-powerful tranquillizers next time.

475
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:26,516
Don't cry, I've given your life a purpose.

476
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:30,729
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

477
00:50:30,813 --> 00:50:31,980
Freeze!

478
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:34,566
-Hold it right there!
-Put your hands in the air!

479
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:47,453
Now you'll make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.

480
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:49,204
-Get down here!
-Turn it off!

481
00:50:51,123 --> 00:50:53,166
Sing, stop that thing, I'm taking him down.

482
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,292
Fine.

483
00:50:54,376 --> 00:50:55,710
Move!

484
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:57,879
-How do you turn it off?
-Tell him, asshole!

485
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:00,465
One key will unlock it.
-Where is it?

486
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:02,716
-It's in the box.
-Box?

487
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,470
Fuck!

488
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:11,558
-Which key? Which key?
-Tell him which key it is!

489
00:51:11,642 --> 00:51:13,935
-Time's running out.
-Shut up and get down here!

490
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,269
Now, asshole!

491
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:21,609
What's more important to you, Officer?
Arresting me or the life of a human being?

492
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:25,988
Get down on your knees, asshole!
Hands behind your head!

493
00:51:26,072 --> 00:51:28,698
-Tapp!
-Sick bastard!

494
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:32,661
-Yes, I'm sick, Officer.
-Tapp, there's a hundred keys here!

495
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:35,372
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.

496
00:51:35,456 --> 00:51:39,084
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.

497
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:42,086
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.

498
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:47,174
I'm sick of 'em all!

499
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:49,218
Tapp!

500
00:51:58,352 --> 00:52:00,812
No! No! Tapp! Tapp!

501
00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:03,940
Shit! You're OK. Let me see.

502
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,112
I'll be back, I'm gonna be back, OK? I'll be back.

503
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:44,893
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

504
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:17,270
I had you.

505
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,773
I had you on your knees.

506
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,818
But you're running. You're running.

507
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:27,405
You're running scared cos...
cos we had you.

508
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:30,866
We're gonna close this case.

509
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:35,037
Gonna close it. Right, Sing? Right?

510
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:37,164
We're gonna close it, Sing.

511
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:49,133
"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.

512
00:54:50,135 --> 00:54:52,136
We need to search this room again.

513
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,221
What are you doing over there?

514
00:54:56,474 --> 00:54:57,849
Excuse me.

515
00:54:57,934 --> 00:55:00,102
Just because I'm stuck in this room with you

516
00:55:00,186 --> 00:55:03,272
doesn't mean I have to report
to you every 10 seconds.

517
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:07,733
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

518
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,028
What do you want me to do? I'm on a leash.

519
00:55:11,113 --> 00:55:13,364
That's exactly why we need to talk and think.

520
00:55:13,448 --> 00:55:16,659
-I am thinking!
-Then don't keep me in the dark

521
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:18,786
about what you're thinking!

522
00:55:22,331 --> 00:55:23,957
Turn off the lights.

523
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:25,375
What?

524
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:28,378
Turn them off now, please.

525
00:55:28,462 --> 00:55:31,298
-Why?
-Just turn them off for a second.

526
00:55:46,645 --> 00:55:48,271
Jesus. Behind you.

527
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:54,819
How come we didn't see that before?

528
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:58,865
The lights in here hadn't charged it.
It's glow-in-the-dark paint or something.

529
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,779
-Open it!
-It's locked.

530
00:56:42,906 --> 00:56:46,033
The key... the one from my envelope.
Where is it?

531
00:56:50,037 --> 00:56:52,538
Where the fuck? Here.

532
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:22,149
A cellphone.

533
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:24,527
The most beautiful invention on this planet.

534
00:57:29,824 --> 00:57:32,534
Make that second-most beautiful invention.

535
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:34,202
Give me that.

536
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:38,998
Are you joking? You're going to put something
you found in this room in your mouth?

537
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,542
Yes, I'm willing to risk it.

538
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:43,293
Give me that sweet cancer.

539
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:47,464
I don't care, I really don't.

540
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:49,550
Give me one of those.

541
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:52,177
The cigarettes
are harmless, I promise.

542
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:58,182
Smoking is only poisonous when it ends
in bloodshed. Think about this.

543
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:00,268
You don't need a gun to kill Adam.

544
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,937
May I please have a cigarette?

545
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,440
I'm trying the police.

546
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:17,784
Shit.

547
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:22,037
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.

548
00:58:24,332 --> 00:58:26,125
Wait a minute.

549
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:28,252
This has happened before.

550
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:35,675
Last night, after I finished at the hospital...

551
00:58:38,178 --> 00:58:40,221
...I was walking back to my car.

552
00:58:42,141 --> 00:58:44,183
I thought I was alone, but...

553
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:47,311
...I'm sure someone else was there.

554
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,727
Great.

555
01:00:15,434 --> 01:00:19,854
That... thing... was waiting for me.

556
01:00:29,864 --> 01:00:32,533
How did you know to turn off the lights?

557
01:00:32,617 --> 01:00:35,786
-Who cares? It worked.
-Yeah, but how did you know?

558
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,454
Instinct.

559
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:38,914
Instinct?

560
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:40,791
-Yeah.
-You know what?

561
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,584
You're a terrible liar.

562
01:00:43,669 --> 01:00:46,295
You say that like you know me.

563
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:49,382
What else aren't you telling me?

564
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:52,093
Well, um, let's see...

565
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:56,346
On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time,
Scott Tibbs,

566
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,890
stabbed me with a rusty nail -
I didn't tell you that.

567
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,852
My last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk,

568
01:01:01,936 --> 01:01:04,396
broke up with me because I was too angry.

569
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,108
-One of my toenails is slightly...
-Just stop it!

570
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:11,360
You knew to turn off these lights.

571
01:01:11,444 --> 01:01:14,446
-Whatever.
-I'm dealing with a juvenile.

572
01:01:15,574 --> 01:01:18,367
-You wanna know?
-Yeah!

573
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:21,744
Here it is.

574
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,506
Come.

575
01:01:36,676 --> 01:01:38,719
Oh, God.

576
01:01:44,558 --> 01:01:46,684
W-Where did you get this?

577
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:49,145
It was in your wallet.

578
01:01:49,229 --> 01:01:51,230
Behind the photo of your daughter.

579
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:55,192
-Why didn't you show me this before?
-I couldn't.

580
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:01,114
I'm sorry.

581
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:14,501
What are you doing to them, you bastard?

582
01:02:22,969 --> 01:02:25,220
OK. OK.

583
01:02:26,305 --> 01:02:28,348
OK, I've got to think now.

584
01:02:31,101 --> 01:02:33,102
Think about this -

585
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:35,646
you don't need a gun to kill Adam.

586
01:02:36,981 --> 01:02:39,524
When there's that much poison in your blood,

587
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:42,819
the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.

588
01:03:16,768 --> 01:03:18,811
What are you doing?

589
01:03:25,527 --> 01:03:28,862
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

590
01:03:29,988 --> 01:03:33,241
Shh. Adam, listen to me.

591
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:35,535
I want you to play along with me on this.

592
01:03:43,459 --> 01:03:45,794
You got that?

593
01:03:58,014 --> 01:04:00,891
So, you er... You still want that cigarette?

594
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:04,061
Um... yeah.

595
01:04:04,145 --> 01:04:06,188
Sure.

596
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,919
There! I've done it!

597
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:20,298
I've killed him with the poison like you wanted!

598
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:22,425
Now where's my family?

599
01:05:22,509 --> 01:05:23,968
Where are they?

600
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:29,389
Aaaargh!

601
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,604
-Aagh! Jesus Christ!
-What are you...?

602
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:38,732
I-I-I just got electrocuted!

603
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,816
What?

604
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:43,402
Jesus. That was our way out!

605
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:46,280
Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me!

606
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:48,699
-Get it off!
-Stop acting!

607
01:05:48,784 --> 01:05:53,037
You think I would make that up just to mess up
your stupid fucking charade?

608
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,746
All right, that's it.

609
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,304
Damn it!

610
01:06:17,893 --> 01:06:19,936
I remember everything now.

611
01:06:22,147 --> 01:06:24,399
I remember how I got here.

612
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:57,943
Oh...

613
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,708
Great.

614
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:46,488
Is someone there?

615
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,084
I can hear you.

616
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,155
Huh!

617
01:09:35,283 --> 01:09:36,826
What the...?

618
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,872
What the Christ...?

619
01:09:50,673 --> 01:09:53,007
What the...?

620
01:09:57,762 --> 01:09:59,805
Huh!

621
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:02,891
Who is that?

622
01:10:02,976 --> 01:10:05,686
Who's in there?

623
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,771
Come out!

624
01:10:07,856 --> 01:10:09,898
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

625
01:10:25,913 --> 01:10:26,663
Aagh!

626
01:10:53,063 --> 01:10:54,814
Who is this?

627
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:57,275
Daddy?

628
01:10:57,359 --> 01:10:58,610
Diana.

629
01:10:58,694 --> 01:11:00,778
Daddy, is that you?

630
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:04,573
Yeah, baby, it's me, I'm here.

631
01:11:04,657 --> 01:11:07,075
I-I'm scared, Daddy.

632
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,287
Don't worry, honey. Everything's gonna be OK.

633
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:14,082
-Where's Mommy?
-She's here with me.

634
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,292
Let me talk to her, sweetie.

635
01:11:16,376 --> 01:11:18,461
OK? Put Mommy on.

636
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:21,923
The bad man from my room is here.

637
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:24,884
He has us tied up...

638
01:11:24,968 --> 01:11:27,219
And he has a gun.

639
01:11:27,303 --> 01:11:30,055
Wh-What man?

640
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:32,182
Please come home, Daddy.

641
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:34,601
Hello?

642
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:36,728
Hello?

643
01:11:37,772 --> 01:11:38,772
Diana?

644
01:11:39,898 --> 01:11:41,065
Diana?

645
01:11:42,275 --> 01:11:43,734
Diana!

646
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:48,238
Larry.

647
01:11:48,323 --> 01:11:51,533
Ali? Is that you?

648
01:11:51,617 --> 01:11:53,660
Is Adam there?

649
01:11:55,537 --> 01:11:57,121
Well, how do you know...

650
01:11:58,248 --> 01:11:59,749
Ali...

651
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:02,835
What is going on?

652
01:12:03,962 --> 01:12:05,880
Don't believe Adam's lies.

653
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:11,218
He knows you.
He knew all about you before today.

654
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:17,516
Hello? Ali?

655
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,434
Ali?

656
01:12:21,728 --> 01:12:23,187
Hello!

657
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:25,272
Goddamn you!

658
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:28,734
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you.

659
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:31,404
You hear me, you son of a bitch? I'll kill you!

660
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:39,619
Damn!

661
01:12:40,704 --> 01:12:43,123
Are they OK?

662
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:49,711
My wife, she er... She mentioned your name.

663
01:12:52,132 --> 01:12:54,174
What did she say?

664
01:12:55,885 --> 01:12:58,011
She told me...

665
01:12:58,095 --> 01:13:00,179
not to believe you.

666
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:02,932
Believe me about what?

667
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:08,187
She told me you knew me.

668
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:14,234
Who are you?

669
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:17,362
You know who I am.

670
01:13:17,446 --> 01:13:21,283
Stop the lies! You're a liar!
I need to know the truth!

671
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:25,870
I'm a liar?

672
01:13:26,955 --> 01:13:29,165
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

673
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,835
Work at a hospital, saving sick children?

674
01:13:32,919 --> 01:13:35,671
You told me
that after you left your house last night,

675
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:37,755
you went to work at a hospital.

676
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,134
-That's because it's the truth.
-No, it's not.

677
01:13:41,218 --> 01:13:43,428
Your wife is right, Larry.

678
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:48,308
You don't recall getting your picture taken
in that parking lot?

679
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:09,160
I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near
a hospital last night.

680
01:14:17,043 --> 01:14:19,544
It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.

681
01:14:19,629 --> 01:14:22,088
I've been taking pictures of you for days now.

682
01:14:28,678 --> 01:14:30,804
-Why?
-You want to know what I do?

683
01:14:30,889 --> 01:14:33,390
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you,

684
01:14:33,475 --> 01:14:35,893
who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries.

685
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:38,604
Last night, I went to your house.

686
01:14:38,688 --> 01:14:40,940
and watched you leave.

687
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,440
I followed you...

688
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,693
...all the way to that shit-bag hotel.

689
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:52,659
You've er... had these with you the whole time?

690
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:55,661
I found them in there with the hacksaws.

691
01:14:56,704 --> 01:14:58,664
I don't know how they got there.

692
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:04,544
-Right! You're so full of it!
-Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!

693
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:07,422
But my camera isn't. It doesn't know how to lie.

694
01:15:07,506 --> 01:15:10,466
It only shows you what's put right in front of it.

695
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:13,719
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

696
01:15:13,804 --> 01:15:16,263
You got out of there pretty fast.

697
01:15:24,897 --> 01:15:26,898
Why did you um...

698
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:30,068
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

699
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,195
I didn't know if you were going to make it.

700
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:38,075
I gave you a precise time at which to page me.

701
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:40,994
You can't do that.

702
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,872
It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.

703
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,796
-What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?
-Look, um...

704
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,508
It was wrong of me to make you come here.

705
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:59,262
-But I thought we've...
-No, no. Please.

706
01:16:01,347 --> 01:16:02,556
I'm sorry.

707
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:17,736
You tell anyone you were here?

708
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,363
No.

709
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,542
Hello.

710
01:16:36,713 --> 01:16:39,173
-It's for you.
-For me?

711
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:54,312
Hello.

712
01:16:56,315 --> 01:16:59,984
I know what you're doing... Doctor.

713
01:17:02,028 --> 01:17:04,070
I...

714
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:16,290
I have to go.

715
01:17:16,374 --> 01:17:18,626
-What happened?
-I gotta go.

716
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:38,478
Who was it?

717
01:17:38,562 --> 01:17:40,188
Who was what?

718
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:43,440
The person who paid you to follow me.
Who was it?

719
01:17:43,524 --> 01:17:47,569
He calls himself Bob and he gives me
the money upfront. 200 bucks a night.

720
01:17:47,654 --> 01:17:50,364
If I'd known I'd end up here,
I'd have asked for a lot more.

721
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:53,492
What does that mean?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?

722
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:56,535
What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.

723
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:00,122
I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.

724
01:18:00,207 --> 01:18:03,793
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

725
01:18:03,877 --> 01:18:07,213
I took the shots and went straight home
to develop them.

726
01:18:07,296 --> 01:18:10,173
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe

727
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:13,885
in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at
the guy I've been taking shots of.

728
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:18,139
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me
is the one who put us here.

729
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:19,224
Maybe.

730
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:21,350
Of course it is! What did he look like?

731
01:18:21,434 --> 01:18:23,602
-Just a guy.
-Was he tall? Skinny? Obese?

732
01:18:23,687 --> 01:18:26,772
-I don't take notes.
-You must remember something about him.

733
01:18:26,856 --> 01:18:29,400
-I can't.
-You don't remember a thing about the guy?

734
01:18:29,484 --> 01:18:32,111
-I told you, I...
-For fuck's sake! I give up!

735
01:18:32,194 --> 01:18:35,446
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

736
01:18:46,165 --> 01:18:47,165
Tapp.

737
01:18:50,503 --> 01:18:53,797
-Detective Tapp.
-Whoa.

738
01:18:53,881 --> 01:18:57,008
The guy who paid me to take these photos
was not a cop.

739
01:18:57,093 --> 01:19:00,011
No, no. He was discharged from the police force.

740
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,596
He broke down after his partner was killed.

741
01:19:02,681 --> 01:19:05,975
But that didn't stop him harassing me.
The guy became obsessed.

742
01:19:06,059 --> 01:19:09,520
He's convinced I must have somehow
been involved with the murders.

743
01:19:09,604 --> 01:19:12,231
He's crazy. And you helped him.

744
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:16,109
You took money from him to invade my privacy.

745
01:19:16,193 --> 01:19:18,111
How could you do that?

746
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:20,864
-Call it my need to eat.
-Right.

747
01:19:20,948 --> 01:19:24,784
Right. You know what, Adam,
you're not a victim of this game.

748
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:26,827
-You're part of it.
-Oh, really?

749
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:29,413
This cop thinks you're the one behind it all.

750
01:19:29,497 --> 01:19:33,167
I told you, he's not a cop.
He's a bottom feeder, just like you!

751
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:36,086
What are you pissed off about?
The fact I took shots of you

752
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:39,548
or the fact that I took shots of you
while you cheated on your wife?

753
01:19:39,631 --> 01:19:43,259
-I did not cheat on her!
-What do you care what I think anyway?

754
01:19:43,343 --> 01:19:48,431
I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in
peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gangbang.

755
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:05,821
How did I get here? I had...

756
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:07,740
I had everything in order.

757
01:20:09,868 --> 01:20:12,203
My whole life was in perfect order.

758
01:20:39,812 --> 01:20:42,147
Sweetheart, are you OK?

759
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,737
Mommy just needs you to be
really, really, really, really strong right now.

760
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:53,866
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

761
01:20:54,992 --> 01:20:56,785
You got that?

762
01:20:56,869 --> 01:20:59,537
OK. That's my good girl.

763
01:21:22,559 --> 01:21:26,729
Hey, was there someone else
at your house last night.

764
01:21:26,814 --> 01:21:28,815
besides your wife and daughter?

765
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:31,567
-No.
-Well, there's someone here.

766
01:21:48,834 --> 01:21:50,835
I know him.

767
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:53,504
-Zep.
-Who?

768
01:21:53,588 --> 01:21:57,550
His name is Zep. He's an orderly at my hospital.

769
01:21:57,634 --> 01:21:59,218
Zep.

770
01:21:59,301 --> 01:22:01,386
You perverted little psychopath.

771
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:05,932
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,

772
01:22:06,016 --> 01:22:08,059
you bastard fuck!

773
01:22:11,312 --> 01:22:12,312
Look.

774
01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:22,114
We're out of time.

775
01:22:40,882 --> 01:22:44,843
Shh, sweetie... sweetie.

776
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:47,220
-Mommy, help me!
-Ssh...

777
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:07,071
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

778
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,743
Now I've got to do what I've got to do, and...

779
01:23:12,828 --> 01:23:16,164
.. I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

780
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:29,718
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?

781
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:32,178
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

782
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,263
La... Larry.

783
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:35,890
Ali?

784
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:37,683
You failed.

785
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,020
Hello?

786
01:23:41,854 --> 01:23:42,729
Hello?

787
01:23:44,732 --> 01:23:46,900
-You!
-Wait.

788
01:23:49,695 --> 01:23:53,031
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

789
01:23:53,115 --> 01:23:54,991
Give me... Give me the phone.

790
01:23:56,117 --> 01:23:58,035
Give it to me!

791
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:10,630
Larry?

792
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:13,341
Ali! Honey, are you all right?

793
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:16,552
No... No, we're not. Get down!

794
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:20,640
-Larry, where are you?
-I don't know.

795
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:23,225
I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.

796
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,019
Wh-What are you talking about?

797
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,439
-I'm so sorry, Ali.
-Honey, we need you here.

798
01:24:29,524 --> 01:24:31,817
So sorry for everything. It's my fault.

799
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:34,403
Forgive me, I've always been happy with you.

800
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,194
Mommy!

801
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:38,489
Aagh!

802
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:39,407
Jesus!

803
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:42,827
Ali!

804
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:01,468
Mommy!

805
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,140
Ali! Ali!

806
01:25:07,475 --> 01:25:08,517
Mommy!

807
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:16,941
Aargh! Aaargh!

808
01:25:24,032 --> 01:25:24,949
Freeze!

809
01:25:35,543 --> 01:25:37,377
Oh, no!

810
01:25:41,548 --> 01:25:43,966
What the fuck?

811
01:25:45,135 --> 01:25:47,219
-Yaaaa!
-Ya!

812
01:26:00,733 --> 01:26:03,193
Argh! Urgh!

813
01:26:10,408 --> 01:26:12,451
Mrs. Gordon?

814
01:26:15,246 --> 01:26:17,289
Diana!

815
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,920
I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.

816
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:54,240
Lawrence!

817
01:26:59,578 --> 01:27:01,287
Lawrence, get up!

818
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:15,008
Lawrence! Get up!

819
01:27:16,552 --> 01:27:17,761
I need you!

820
01:27:31,316 --> 01:27:34,819
Oh, thank God, I thought you were dead.

821
01:27:40,157 --> 01:27:42,325
He... He... He electrocuted me.

822
01:27:43,077 --> 01:27:46,705
I told you.
The same thing happened to me. See?

823
01:27:46,789 --> 01:27:48,915
I wasn't lying. See?

824
01:27:48,999 --> 01:27:50,916
Fuck this shit!

825
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:00,647
No!

826
01:29:02,692 --> 01:29:04,485
Lawrence, calm down.

827
01:29:04,569 --> 01:29:06,779
-There must be a way out of this.
-Shut up!

828
01:29:06,862 --> 01:29:10,448
Just shut up! My family needs me!

829
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:14,285
No! God!

830
01:29:14,369 --> 01:29:16,370
God! No!

831
01:29:16,455 --> 01:29:17,872
Argh!

832
01:29:22,919 --> 01:29:25,462
Lawrence! I have a family too.

833
01:29:25,546 --> 01:29:29,466
I don't see them, that's my mistake.
It's a mistake I'd like to fix.

834
01:29:34,095 --> 01:29:36,680
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.

835
01:29:38,642 --> 01:29:39,767
Lawrence!

836
01:29:40,852 --> 01:29:42,144
Stop it.

837
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,691
Lawrence, just calm down.

838
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:51,402
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out!

839
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:52,362
Lawrence!

840
01:29:54,448 --> 01:29:56,449
No! What are you... No!

841
01:29:56,533 --> 01:29:59,076
Oh, my God! Lawrence!

842
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:03,455
What are you doing?

843
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:09,873
What... are you doing?

844
01:31:31,228 --> 01:31:33,521
What are you... What are you...

845
01:31:35,273 --> 01:31:37,357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

846
01:31:39,902 --> 01:31:41,903
Lawrence, don't! No!

847
01:31:41,988 --> 01:31:43,989
No, Lawrence, please!

848
01:31:44,073 --> 01:31:46,491
I'm begging you!

849
01:31:47,075 --> 01:31:50,101
Lawrence! It's not me who did this to you!

850
01:31:50,862 --> 01:31:53,422
-You have to die.
-No! I want to live!

851
01:31:53,423 --> 01:31:55,424
-I want to live!
-I'm sorry.

852
01:31:56,609 --> 01:31:58,943
-My family...
-Argh!

853
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:15,149
There! I've done it!

854
01:32:15,776 --> 01:32:17,819
Now show them to me!

855
01:32:21,299 --> 01:32:23,025
Show them to me.

856
01:32:23,026 --> 01:32:25,319
-Thank you very much, Officer.
-Larry?

857
01:32:25,902 --> 01:32:27,486
Did you get through to him?

858
01:32:27,487 --> 01:32:29,572
-There's still no answer.
-It's all right. I've called the police.

859
01:32:29,573 --> 01:32:31,616
Everything is OK.

860
01:32:48,148 --> 01:32:49,215
You bastard!

861
01:32:49,216 --> 01:32:52,385
I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

862
01:32:52,469 --> 01:32:54,470
You fucking bastard!

863
01:32:54,554 --> 01:32:58,223
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!

864
01:32:58,308 --> 01:33:00,434
I'll fucking kill you!

865
01:33:00,518 --> 01:33:02,061
I'll fucking kill you.

866
01:33:11,354 --> 01:33:13,521
You're too late.

867
01:33:13,906 --> 01:33:16,658
-Why?
-It's the rules.

868
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:22,079
Argh!

869
01:34:00,698 --> 01:34:02,491
You're gonna be all right.

870
01:34:02,575 --> 01:34:05,202
You're just wounded...
wounded in the shoulder.

871
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:09,339
I... have... to go.... and get help.

872
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,740
If.. If I don't g...g... get help....

873
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:18,456
I'm going to bleed to death.

874
01:34:18,457 --> 01:34:20,875
Don't leave me!

875
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:22,251
No!

876
01:34:22,336 --> 01:34:24,378
No! No!

877
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:28,382
No! Ow!

878
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:39,109
Don't... Don't worry.

879
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:40,694
I'll bring someone back.

880
01:34:40,695 --> 01:34:42,320
I promise.

881
01:34:47,721 --> 01:34:51,721
Lawrence! Lawrence!

882
01:35:01,522 --> 01:35:03,522
We're gonna be okay?

883
01:35:04,423 --> 01:35:07,923
I... I wouldn't lie to you.

884
01:35:29,183 --> 01:35:31,226
Key.

885
01:35:49,451 --> 01:35:51,494
Key! Key! Key!

886
01:36:13,556 --> 01:36:15,575
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle.</i>

887
01:36:16,559 --> 01:36:18,936
<i>Or as they called you around the hospital...</i>

888
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,142
<i>...Zep.</i>

889
01:36:21,597 --> 01:36:23,340
<i>I want you to make a choice.</i>

890
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,145
<i>There's a slow-acting poison
coursing through your system</i>

891
01:36:31,146 --> 01:36:34,064
<i>which only I have the antidote for.</i>

892
01:36:34,249 --> 01:36:37,178
<i>Will you murder a mother and her child</i>

893
01:36:37,179 --> 01:36:39,237
<i>to save yourself?</i>

894
01:36:39,238 --> 01:36:41,281
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

895
01:36:41,282 --> 01:36:42,532
Mrs. Gordon!

896
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:46,886
<i>Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.</i>

897
01:36:46,887 --> 01:36:49,306
-Why?
-It's the rules.

898
01:37:36,558 --> 01:37:40,436
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.

899
01:37:51,197 --> 01:37:54,082
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.

900
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:56,484
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.

901
01:37:56,485 --> 01:38:00,204
<i>-I'm sick from disease eating away at me inside.
-Sounds like our friend Jigsaw.</i>

902
01:38:00,205 --> 01:38:02,865
<i>I'm sick of people who don't
appreciating their blessings.</i>

903
01:38:02,866 --> 01:38:06,794
Looks like our guy likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.

904
01:38:06,795 --> 01:38:10,672
<i>Hello, Mark, Paul, Amanda,
Zep, Adam, Dr. Gordon.</i>

905
01:38:10,756 --> 01:38:12,465
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

906
01:38:38,698 --> 01:38:42,743
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

907
01:38:43,745 --> 01:38:44,987
But not you.

908
01:38:45,914 --> 01:38:47,282
Not any more.

909
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:51,426
Aaargh! Aaargh!

910
01:38:51,427 --> 01:38:54,304
- Game over.
- Aaargh!

911
01:38:54,305 --> 01:38:57,407
Aaargh! Aaargh!

912
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:00,226
Don't! Don't!

913
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:03,980
Don't! Aaargh!

914
