1
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,081
-So you got everything? You gonna
play video games the whole flight..

2
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,965
..or do you think
you might actually crack a book?

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,531
-Probably read some.

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,162
-Well, if I write you an email,
don't be scared to write back.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,166
Let your old man know what you're
thinking about, what's going on.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,681
..Yeah/
If you want, we could try Skyping..

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,968
..once a week or something/
All right.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,565
Yeah. Okay.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,927
You got the drawings
for your science deal?

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,167
Yeah, think so.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,164
Well, they turned out great, by the way.
Really great.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,651
Thanks.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,286
What..? ls your computer charged?/
Yeah.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,481
What do you think is the first thing
you're gonna do when you get home?

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,210
I don't know.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,642
I really cherish this communication
we have. You know, it's just..

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,882
Your answers are so../
What?

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,291
Just keep practicing the piano.
You're really good.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,046
They spend so much time
at that school of yours..

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,368
Music is something you'll use in life.

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,291
And don't forget to..
You want those sesame things.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,891
Yeah/
All right.

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,644
There you go. Thank you.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,444
Okay.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,328
I'll probably make it over there in October.
I'll try to see you in that first recital.

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,126
And hopefully catch a soccer game
while I'm there.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,484
I might not even play soccer this year.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,081
Oh, that'd be a big mistake. Trust me.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,011
I'm not that good/
Oh, no, you're pretty good.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,804
You are.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,400
I missed summer training camp. The
chances of me starting are miniscule.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,768
Well, just tell the coach the situation.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,884
Your dad lives in Europe.
You really wanted to be there.

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,402
You know, blame me.
"My parents stink, but I'm really serious."

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,648
But I'm not serious, Dad.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,047
I don't care that much.

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,646
Well, you don't have to decide right now.
You know, just think about it.

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,850
All I'm saying is that team sports
are important, you know?

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,723
Here we are.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,407
I love this airport/
It's awesome.

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,331
It's cool, right?
You excited about seeing your mom?

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,845
Yeah, and all my friends.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,446
Yeah. What about your boarding pass,
passport?

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,126
You feel confident
about making the connection?

45
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,847
I did this before/
But not with a tricky connection like this.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,646
Remember, when you land,
you stay in your seat..

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,526
..somebody from the airline
is gonna take you to the gate, all right?

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,042
It's not a problem/
Okay. All right.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,889
Oh, boy.

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,685
Well, looks like maybe
we should just do this thing, huh?

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,644
Okay, come here. Oh, God.

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,366
I'm gonna do my best
to make that recital, okay?

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,490
You know, I wouldn't bother.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,926
What makes you say that?/
I'm not being mean, but it'd be easier..

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,044
..if you didn't come to the recital/
How come?

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,811
Be better if you visited
on a "nothing" weekend.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,324
But I wanna see you play/
It's because Mom hates you so much.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,650
She'd be really stressed if you were there
and then it'd be tense for me.

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,446
You know, go on/
Thank you.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,649
We wouldn't have any time to hang out/
Don't worry. We'll figure that out.

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,684
I just don't want you to worry about it,
you know?

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,326
I mean, you know
how much I miss you, right?

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,041
Why do you think
she still hates me so much?

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,921
I don't know. I think she hates Daniel
more than she hates you.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,768
Right/
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

66
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,207
We should just do this thing/
Yeah.

67
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,203
Is there anything I can do to help?

68
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,880
I don't know/
But you know I love you, right?

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,684
Yeah, I know/
All right.

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,008
This has been the best summer
of my life.

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,089
Really?/
Yeah.

72
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,527
Well, me too.

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,326
I told you this Greece thing
was gonna be great.

74
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,602
And it was/
Okay. All right.

75
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,125
I love you, pal.

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,810
Love you too, Dad/
Okay.

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,361
Okay, shake my hand. All right.

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,528
Bye/
All right. See you.

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,365
Okay.

80
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,564
Okay.

81
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,241
So, what's going on?

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,171
They voted against it/
What? The wind turbines?

83
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,160
Six months dealing with those people,
everyone agreed it was great.

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,367
So, what happened?

85
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,966
They don't like the way
it looks on that hill.

86
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,481
No. I thought it was a done deal/
It was.

87
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,251
That's what's so infuriating/
Can they do that?

88
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,649
Of course, they've done it.
That's it. It's over, <b>finis.</b>

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,881
I'm sorry/
No, no. It's just so frustrating.

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,963
I can't take it anymore.

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,527
I'm gonna take that job with Remy.

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,882
No, no.
No, you don't wanna work for him.

93
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,963
Why not?/
For the government?

94
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,444
This is different. We need laws. That's
the only way anything is gonna happen.

95
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,444
Not the only way.
You have been getting good work done.

96
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,762
I've been thinking.
This is the way to go.

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,161
Let me remind you
you do not like that guy.

98
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,085
You worked for him before.
You complained about him.

99
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,561
He gets things done.
That's how I'm gonna be.

100
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,131
Okay/
A real bitch, okay?

101
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,127
Well, every time I look at that guy, all I
see is ambition. Sorry, I don't trust him.

102
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,887
He's going from nonprofit to government
to have people kiss his ass.

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,445
I don't care about him.

104
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,887
And I think
you're gonna be miserable.

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,560
Just with all the politicking
and compromise.

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,764
I've made my decision.
I'm tired of being the dogooder..

107
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,651
..that rolls a boulder up
and watches it roll down.

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,088
Isn't Remy the guy who used to throw
his pens at his assistant?

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,402
I should have taken this job a year ago.

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,770
I was scared of the amount of work,
but I think it's the best opportunity.

111
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,241
And it's more money, and I'm doing it.

112
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,171
Okay. Are you sure?

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,603
No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?/
All right.

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,041
What's gonna happen to everyone
if I leave?

115
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,766
Like Francoise and..
I mean, they count on me.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,365
What do you think?

117
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,245
Should I take it or not?/
I don't have an opinion.

118
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,445
I don't wanna see you rush into
a decision because of this wind turbine.

119
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,331
Not just that.
It's been stirring in me all summer.

120
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,891
I know/
I should do it.

121
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,242
All right.. Then do it/
I'm doing it.

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,926
I'm doing it. All right?

123
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,208
Oh, God. I wish things were simpler.

124
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,046
If I leave, I get fucked,
if I stay, I get fucked.

125
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
There's always a catch.

126
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,086
The world is fucked/
Yeah, maybe.

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,564
Oh, God. We finally have a vacation
and the girls are sick for two weeks.

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,481
I know. I have the perfect son.
He lives a million miles away.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,166
Or the love of your life can't clean up
after himself or learn how to shave.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,643
Who's that? I mean, you're not talking
about Captain Cleanup.

131
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,925
Captain Cleanup. The one that's
been missing in action all these years.

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,442
What'd you expect
at this point in your life, missy?

133
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,290
God.

134
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,448
Oh, look at them. They're so cute.

135
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,041
They look like conjoined twins.

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,447
Oh, my God, I'm gonna take a picture.

137
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,247
Hey, did Ella finish that apple?

138
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,201
The../ Take food out
of your child's mouth?

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,805
Yeah/
Okay.

140
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,361
Well, it's all brown.

141
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,046
No, no, no, there's a spot here.

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,931
Ella, this is evidence of your father
stealing food from you.

143
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,003
If you become bulimic or anorexic..

144
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,685
Jesus/
..It's not my fault.

145
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,287
Don't blame it all on your mother/
Ella, this is a family apple.

146
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,523
I'm teaching you the value of sharing.
I love you, honey.

147
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,245
So sweet.

148
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,290
You will remember this vacation different
than we will.

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,568
That's for sure.
I see that with my mom.

150
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,166
She remembers my childhood
different than I do.

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
Please, stop filming me/
Okay.

152
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,922
God. I love your mom.
You're always so hard on her.

153
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,528
You missed the fuckedup years.
You're just getting the good era.

154
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,048
The fuckedup years. That reminds me,
talking about fucked up..

155
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,171
..did I ever tell you the story
of my little Cleopatra kitty?

156
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,281
No/ No?
I think you would remember if I did.

157
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,849
It's the story.. You know, when I was a
little girl, I had this cat named Cleopatra.

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,731
Every spring, she'd jump the fence,
get pregnant..

159
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,010
..and always end up
with a litter of exactly two kittens.

160
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,770
Two kitties?/
Two kitties.

161
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,928
Every time, every year, two cats.

162
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,724
I mean, it's just amazing.

163
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,766
Then one day, I was, like, around 30,
and was having lunch with my dad..

164
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,969
..and I was remembering..
Mentioning little Cleopatra..

165
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,281
..and he was like:

166
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,202
"The hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens."

167
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,606
And I was like, "What?"

168
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,531
It turns out.. Listen to this.

169
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,644
There were sometimes
up to seven kittens in that litter.

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,887
Oh, no.

171
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,042
He would take five of them../
Oh, no.

172
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,521
..put them into a bag
with a bunch of ether.

173
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,688
That's terrible.

174
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,127
That was like..

175
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,449
He had forgotten the lie
he and my mom had told me as a kid.

176
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,729
How did he decide which ones to kill?/
I asked him that.

177
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,447
"Did you take the fluffiest? Cutest?"/
Right.

178
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,410
You know? He just started to cry.

179
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,443
Poor Daddy.

180
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,684
We said we were gonna stop.
They wanted to see the ruins.

181
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,927
Should we?

182
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,650
Well, Ella really wanted to.

183
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,128
Yeah, but should we wake them up?/
I don't know.

184
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,290
On our way back to the airport,
we can catch them.

185
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,244
You know we won't/
Probably not.

186
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,561
Oh, God.

187
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,883
So long, ancient ruins.
What's so great about you anyway?

188
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,242
Seen one, seen them all.

189
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,408
Oh, my God. We are shitty parents.
We should have stopped.

190
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,369
It's okay/
It's culture. Go back.

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,444
You gotta put character into these kids/
Yeah, yeah.

192
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,725
We're teaching them a valuable lesson.
If you snooze, you lose in this world.

193
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,888
And when the girls are in rehab..

194
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,289
..recovering from 10 years of addiction
to coke and speed..

195
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,484
..they'll say, "We never felt
comfortable falling asleep.

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,844
Daddy used to tell us, 'You snooze, you
lose."' And that'll be your fault again.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,288
Yeah, well, we are shitty parents/
I know.

198
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,086
Saying goodbye to Hank sucked.

199
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,961
Why, was he upset?

200
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,403
No, no.
He said it was the best summer of his life.

201
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,931
Well, that's great.

202
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,681
I mean, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. We spoke a bunch.

203
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,089
You know what his main concerns are?/
What?

204
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,285
Pimples and how girls perceive him.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

205
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,000
What do you mean? I'm not like that/
Oh, please.

206
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,764
What?/
That's all you think about.

207
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,651
What?/
Women. I mean..

208
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,287
I'm not complaining,
I'm getting a lot of attention.

209
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,008
But you never stop ogling girls, like,/
I don't ogle girls. I don't ogle girls.

210
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,211
I make love to them with my eyes.

211
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,881
I like the Spanish guy. Or is it Greek?

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,409
I don't know where I'm from,
but I'm very hairy.

213
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,966
Well, I think.. You know,
Henry might have, you know..

214
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,207
What?

215
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,085
With that little Melina girl.

216
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,284
I don't know. He had a crush, but..

217
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,726
Are you kidding?/
What?

218
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,049
Why do you think he said
it was the best summer of his life?

219
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,687
Because he and I
had a good time together?

220
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,890
Jesse/
No, huh?

221
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,481
So, what, you think they..?/
Of course.

222
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,001
They kissed?/
Yeah, they kissed. Yeah, yeah.

223
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,323
I was sworn to secrecy, but he told me/
What did he say?

224
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,091
I'm not supposed to tell you.
I'm not gonna talk.

225
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,009
Come on/
Okay.

226
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,649
He told me he was worried..
You know, concerned about the kissing.

227
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,370
You know, tongue. Her tongue.

228
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,443
What, he kissed her?/
Yeah.

229
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,089
But he was so cute, all nervous, all red,
biting his cheek.

230
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,645
Like when he was little.

231
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,320
So he and Melina were a real thing?/
Yeah.

232
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,483
What's gonna happen now?

233
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,126
I don't know.
They must be friends on Facebook.

234
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,005
Keep in touch for a while/
What if they end up..

235
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,448
..spending their life together,
you know?/ You're so corny.

236
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,369
Sometimes, I'm just like../
No.

237
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,887
What are you, a 12yearold girl?/
I'm just..

238
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,686
First love, do you even remember
who it was?

239
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,805
Yeah, I do. It was you/
Oh, please, like you were a virgin at 23.

240
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,805
You said first love,
not first sexual experience.

241
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,964
Fine. I'm the first woman
you ever fell in love with?

242
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,446
Yeah/
I don't think so.

243
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,611
First one I felt truly connected to, sure.
What, I wasn't your first love?

244
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,683
No, of course not.

245
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,046
No, I just.. I thought I was.

246
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,326
Jesse, stop this. It's dumb/
It's okay. Not a big deal.

247
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,961
No. Okay, how old are you? Come on.

248
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,209
I'm 41 and I've loved only you.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,482
You are so, so working
on our little night already.

250
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,642
Hell, yeah. I got a Trojan in my billfold,
and a rocket in my pocket.

251
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,043
I'm stuck with an American teenager.

252
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,084
I can't believe it.

253
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,760
Do we have to do all that stuff later?

254
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,088
What? Oh, yeah, come on.

255
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,251
It means a lot to Patrick. Ariadni
and Stefanos are already there prepping.

256
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,727
The kids wanted one more big time/
 No.

257
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,002
No, no, but I meant the hotel later.

258
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,568
I just.. I'm not sure I want to go..
Hi, sweetie.

259
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,091
Yeah.

260
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,529
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Well, it's fine. It's fine.

261
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,485
Call me from London.
Have a good flight. Bye.

262
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,371
They were telling them
to turn everything off.

263
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,889
And I asked him to call me from
the plane. I don't like when he flies.

264
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,925
What?

265
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,001
What is it?/
It's just..

266
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,806
I don't know. I don't know. I don't..

267
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,887
I just don't think I can keep doing this.

268
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,525
What?

269
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,651
It's just every summer, every Christmas.
You know, it's like..

270
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,845
It makes me ill every time/
It wouldn't be so bad..

271
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,489
..you know, like if we were sending him
to boarding school or just..

272
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,843
I don't know, if his mom and I
got along a little bit better.

273
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,771
It's like we're sending him back
across enemy lines.

274
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,405
It really hit me this time.

275
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,809
It's, like, he's gonna be a freshman
in high school.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,606
Four more years
and he's gonna be on his own.

277
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,168
Maybe that's good. Only four years/
This is the crucial time.

278
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,843
I just feel like I should be there for him.
Like it's now or never, you know?

279
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,403
No. What do you mean?

280
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,491
I just thought somehow he'd end up
living with us somewhere along the way.

281
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,489
You know, time's going by so fast.

282
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,489
And here we are, it's high school.

283
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,526
There's girls. Next thing you know,
it's college applications.

284
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,484
You're right, maybe it's time.

285
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,049
I mean, it's time to tell his mom all this
and ask if he can come and live with us.

286
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,527
He'd love it.
We can put him in that bilin..

287
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,967
That's never gonna happen, all right?

288
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,767
She's never gonna give me one thing
she's not legally obligated to.

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,447
You wanna call that lawyer again?/
No. He's terrible.

290
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,085
Should I call his mother?

291
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,487
No. Please. Never again.

292
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,451
Look, he doesn't even know
how to throw a baseball.

293
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,125
Who cares?

294
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,245
It's just.. He leads with his elbow.
He throws like a girl.

295
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,091
It's not your fault/
No, it is my fault.

296
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,046
A father is supposed to teach you that/
He just doesn't like baseball.

297
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,971
It's an example.
It's a metaphor for everything.

298
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,051
He's turning 14,
and he needs his father.

299
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,522
Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.

300
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,361
Did I ask you to? Where did that
come from? I'm thinking out loud.

301
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,450
This is the one thing I promised myself
I'd never do..

302
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,449
..and I look up and I'm doing it.

303
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,645
Well, listen, you're a wonderful father.
He loves the relationship you have.

304
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,605
He loves the letters/
He doesn't read the letters.

305
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,486
He reads them. He doesn't compliment/
I know if I miss these years..

306
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,762
..they are never coming back.

307
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,763
Oh, my God/
What?

308
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,287
This is where it ends.

309
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,685
What are you talking about?

310
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,360
This is how people start breaking up/
My God.

311
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,291
You just jumped off a cliff/
No, I'm marking this.

312
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,129
This is the day you light the ticking bomb
that will destroy our lives.

313
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,527
Yeah/
Okay.

314
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,326
First, you don't light a ticking bomb.
You set it.

315
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,082
It has a timer. That's why it ticks/
Whatever. Well, it's ticking right now.

316
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,126
This is how it happens. You're unhappy,
you blame it on the other person.

317
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,001
Resentment grows, you break up/
You're just doing this to shut me up.

318
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,401
Not at all. No/
That's what you're doing.

319
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,410
I'm surprised we lasted this long/
The hyperbole.

320
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,644
We're on parallel tracks,
but now the tracks have crossed.

321
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,609
I'm going west. You're going east.

322
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,088
This is how it happens. I've seen it.
Katherine and Alexander..

323
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,926
You're kidding, right? You're kidding?/
Well, no.

324
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,406
I'm kidding.

325
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,170
And I'm not.

326
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,567
All right?

327
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,330
I'm just..

328
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,364
This is it/
How much longer to the ruins?

329
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,767
Oh, they were closed.

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,126
Yeah/
We.. Yeah.

331
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,041
We're gonna catch them on the way
back when we're going to the airport.

332
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,287
Okay?/
Exactly.

333
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,086
We'll leave early, right? Yeah/
Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,521
What happened to my apple?

335
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,967
Your apple..

336
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,649
Right?

337
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,168
Give me the list/
I don't have it.

338
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,964
It's in your wallet.

339
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,525
In your wallet.

340
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,529
Okay/
Yeah.

341
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,202
Okay, I'm the general.

342
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,488
Who made you general?/
The general, okay?

343
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,884
Private Cleanup.
You don't touch anything.

344
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,249
Nina!

345
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,324
Ariadni.

346
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,240
You gotta do better than that.
No, no, no.

347
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,764
I got you.

348
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,646
Oh, where's my team?
Where's my team?

349
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,724
The red ones.

350
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,411
Okay. Pepper.

351
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,603
I read both. The first one is That Time,
second is <b>This Time.</b>

352
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,848
<b>First is This Time,
second is That Time.</b>

353
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,601
We've got a joke in our family
that This brought us back together..

354
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,001
..and That paid for our apartment/
Okay.

355
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,210
It must be a little weird for Celine,
the way she's in the book like that.

356
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,050
Why? She's gotten used to it.

357
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,165
Second one is sexy. He misses the
plane, they black out the windows..

358
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,882
..and they have sex for days and days
and days like there's no tomorrow, whoa.

359
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,447
Did you guys actually do that?

360
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,640
You did that?/
You read Jesse's third book?

361
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,723
It's better than the first two.

362
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,685
Took longer to write
than the first two put together.

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,726
Third one I didn't read. My wife
gave it to me, but it's too long for me.

364
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,843
The title is long. What's the title?

365
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,686
<b>Temporary Cast Members of a Long
Running But Little Seen Production..</b>

366
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,561
<b>..of a Play Called Fleeting/
Well, exactly, my point.</b>

367
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,762
Everybody else thought
it was too long.

368
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,884
Well, it's a better book.
It's so much more ambitious.

369
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,131
What's that?

370
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,006
No, he says he likes all the books.

371
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,770
He does.

372
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,009
Well..

373
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,362
I love it here. This place is amazing.

374
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,887
Those tomatoes are so amazing.
I can..

375
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,284
I can smell them.

376
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,164
It smells so good.

377
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,131
Yeah, Patrick is very proud of them.

378
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,489
I know it's stupid,
but when we were about to leave Paris..

379
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,571
..I was nervous to come here. Now
we're about to leave, I don't wanna go.

380
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,161
Why were you nervous?/
Yeah, why was that?

381
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,251
This place, it's so full of thousands
of years of myth and tragedy.

382
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,209
Thought something
was gonna happen.

383
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,330
You thought the minotaur
was going to eat your children?

384
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,285
Yes. Exactly.

385
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,680
Well, I've been working on this idea..

386
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,168
..about a group of people
with all these brain abnormalities.

387
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,321
So the book would be like a day in their
life from all their unique points of view.

388
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,364
This older lady has a condition
that makes you feel..

389
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,488
..like you're in a state of déja vu.

390
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,928
Every single experience she has
feels like she's had it before.

391
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,050
She could be sitting here,
seemingly functional.

392
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,443
In her head, she's thinking,
"Didn't he already say that?

393
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,201
Weren't we were here yesterday
having this exact same conversation?"

394
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,243
Like déja vu/
Except all the time.

395
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,410
That's the thing, right?
Everything she takes in.

396
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,764
Breakfast, a newspaper, a movie. She's
convinced she's encountered it already.

397
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,363
That's a real condition?/
Yeah, it's called persistent déja..

398
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,483
It's real, but I can't pronounce it.

399
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,810
Then there's these two other characters
with facial recognition extremes.

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,369
There's this one guy and he can't
recognize his wife of 20 years.

401
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,042
He looks at himself in the mirror,
and he feels this disconnect..

402
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,009
..with that man he's looking at.

403
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,767
Then the other character is the opposite.
A middleaged housewife..

404
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,930
..with exacting memory of every face
she's ever seen.

405
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,004
She lives in a big city,
but to her, it's a small town.

406
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,524
Like, a taxi drives past and she thinks:
"That's the driver who dropped me off..

407
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,081
..at Place des Vosges
three Christmases ago."

408
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,130
Like some old lady
walking on the street, she thinks:

409
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,204
"She sat two seats down from me
on the Metro last year."

410
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,331
So everyone she meets, you know,
to her, feels intimate and connected.

411
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,766
I'm like the first guy.

412
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,123
Like I feel connected to nothing
most of the time, man.

413
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,324
Achilleas, Anna. Hey, you guys.

414
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,046
Hey, look at this kid.

415
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,447
He's having the best summer of us all.

416
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,124
So you were saying
there's three characters, right?

417
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,641
Not just three.
It's a whole group of people.

418
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,447
I'm working on a chapter about a young
Greek man named Achilleas.

419
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,523
Me?/
Well, he's named after you.

420
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,248
The guy is caught in a loop. All he sees
is the transient nature of everything.

421
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,490
He looks out at the sea, thinks it's gonna
be dry and littered with fossils.

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,330
Well, I don't know.

423
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,164
What?/
Sounds pretentious.

424
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,931
It won't be pretentious.
It's gonna be funny.

425
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,282
Really funny.
Like, he picks up a book..

426
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,882
..and he wonders, "Who's gonna be the
last person to read this?"

427
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,687
And that's funny?/
Sometimes I kind of think like that.

428
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,401
Okay. So he doesn't get excited
about tits, cars, booze? Nothing.

429
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,011
He just thinks about death.

430
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,483
Well, not so much death, right?
It's just like transformation.

431
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,729
Like he's seeing too far into the future/
Okay.

432
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,962
I like this idea for a novel.

433
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,802
Add a character of an old man who can't
remember what he had for breakfast..

434
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,050
..but can still hear the song playing
when Sheila Campbell danced topless..

435
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,851
..on the bar at Jury's
when he was 14 years old.

436
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,610
That'd work/
Okay.

437
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,202
You have these people lost in time.
But what's the connection?

438
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,727
Are they gonna have sex?
Don't you need that?

439
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,282
It's not time they're lost in.
It's perception. That's the deal.

440
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,762
No, I'm thinking of setting
the whole novel at a movie.

441
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,965
Like every character comes in contact
with the film On the Waterfront.

442
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,885
<b>Have you seen On the Waterfront?/
On the Waterfront?</b>

443
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,891
Oh, with Brando?/
Yeah.

444
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,483
Yeah, yeah. Okay, the first chapter is
opening weekend, Times Square, 1954.

445
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,607
That old lady with perpetual deja vu
walks into the matinee screening, right?

446
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,323
Except the whole time she's thinking,
"Haven't I already seen this?"

447
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,205
Yeah/
Another chapter is a 1979..

448
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,925
..Paris film studies class.

449
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,524
Then we have a Kazan retrospective
in Munich, 1993.

450
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:18,046
That is time. How is that not time?/
Yeah, it's time. But it's more perception.

451
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,171
You don't like it?/
I think it's gonna be too long.

452
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,249
Well, I like it.

453
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,967
Don't listen to him. He makes bicycles.
Send it to me in galleys.

454
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,687
Will do.

455
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,722
Watch out.

456
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,201
In France, we stuff tomatoes with
tomatoes and peppers with peppers.

457
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,287
We use the same for both because of the
way it reacts differently in terms of taste.

458
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay.

459
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,645
Celine, make sure
you don't stuff them too much..

460
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,411
..because of the way
it overflows in the oven.

461
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,965
Okay/
Gets nasty.

462
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,330
You're doing fine, Celine/
And especially don't listen to Stefanos.

463
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,723
Because he's never made this dish
before or any other dish for that matter.

464
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,611
You know? I mean..

465
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,086
Let go.

466
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,322
Let go of me! Let go.

467
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,690
You guys are fighting.

468
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,641
With knives?
Okay, stop it. Stop fighting with knives.

469
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,969
We're not fighting. We're negotiating/
Yeah.

470
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,043
Negotiating. That's how you call it?

471
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,369
It's a system that we have.

472
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,608
You found a system that works
for you.

473
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,889
I thought it was a relationship.
I like system. That's good.

474
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,963
Not too many, right?/
Not too many.

475
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,085
We used to have that system.

476
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,688
Not too far, you guys!

477
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,721
I don't wanna let this meal go by
without saying thank you to everyone.

478
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,604
And especially you, Patrick.

479
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,043
We had no idea what we were getting
into these last six weeks.

480
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,288
A letter arrives from the university..

481
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,444
..inviting us to the southern
Peloponnese of Greece..

482
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,768
..to the guest house of a great writer?

483
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,201
Sure, why not?

484
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,809
And then at the airport earlier today..

485
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,322
..Hank says this has been
the greatest summer of his life.

486
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,841
That's nice/
And I have to say the same.

487
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,926
Thank you, Patrick. Not just for what
you've done for me and my family..

488
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,203
..but for all the ways you're giving back.
To Patrick.

489
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,889
Thank you, thank you. When I first
saw you at the airport, I thought,

490
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,323
"No way a man dressed like that
could be a man of letters."

491
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,683
But now,
now I think I've learned your secret.

492
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,766
We've had many great writers here
over the past decade.

493
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,209
But never one who had a partner
more interesting than themselves.

494
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,211
I keep telling you.

495
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,961
And Celine,
it's been so great to have you..

496
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,004
..and your daughters'
wonderful vitality around here.

497
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,410
And I'm so happy that you were able
to meet my dear friend, Natalia.

498
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,285
Whose husband Elias
was like a brother to me.

499
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,964
Sorry about the curtains/
Shouldn't have given cherries.

500
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,447
It was my fault/
So beautiful.

501
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,160
Thanks for including Anna and me
this summer.

502
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,930
He usually puts me to work.

503
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,681
But when I bring Anna, he lets me sit
at the table of the grownups.

504
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,326
Welcome to the grownups table.

505
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,244
How long have you two been together?/
Since last summer.

506
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,489
We met one year ago in my last few
days here with Grandpa.

507
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,843
Before I had to go back to Athens/
We met at my cast party.

508
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,930
I was doing Shakespeare
at Epidavros. Yup.

509
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,124
So who did you play?/
I was Perdita in Winter's Tale.

510
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,606
And she was fantastic.

511
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,923
Remember, Patrick,
we went to that?/ Perdita.

512
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,890
"When you do dance,
I wish you a wave 0' the sea..

513
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,890
..that you might ever do nothing
but that."

514
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,731
The way he just performed that
was better than the guy at the play.

515
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,843
People are still talking about that.

516
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,805
The afterparty was even better.
It's where we met.

517
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,322
Yeah. I had an old BSA motorcycle.

518
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,850
Nice/ Yeah.
So we drove around all night.

519
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,522
And then I had to drive her back
to the theater to get her stuff.

520
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,882
And it was dawn/
I'll never forget it.

521
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,409
It's outdoors and seats 12,000 people,
but it was now completely empty.

522
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,811
And she was sitting way up
in the back row.

523
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,040
So I went up on stage
and whispered to her..

524
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,403
Acoustics there are incredible.
I could see his mouth move..

525
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,122
..and then three seconds later,
I could hear his voice in my ear.

526
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,850
What did he say?

527
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,364
Okay/
Private. Private.

528
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,928
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later.

529
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,766
How did you keep in touch?/
We Skyped every day since then.

530
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,329
When we're apart, we have a thing
of putting our laptop by the pillow..

531
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,170
..and fall asleep together.

532
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,368
Oh, that's the new romance.

533
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,325
And when I wake up,
the screen is usually frozen.

534
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,809
And Anna's face
is in some funny position, like:

535
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,049
Let me ask.. Can I ask a question?

536
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,287
Please?/
Yeah.

537
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,131
When you guys Skype,
do you, you know..?

538
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,608
Do you go a little crazy?/
Oh, God, you're being so vulgar.

539
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,087
I'm just being
an amateur anthropologist..

540
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,124
..interested in virtual worlds
on a theoretical level.

541
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,561
So now you're an anthropologist?/
Yeah.

542
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,401
For instance, the sex of the near future,
I'm not making this up..

543
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,049
..but is gonna be just like plugging in,
attaching something to your genitals..

544
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,171
..and you'll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice.

545
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,170
You'll be able to program in
all your preferences.

546
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,127
You'll be able to type in what you want
Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.

547
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,805
I might like that.

548
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,485
All right. Come on/
Yes.

549
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,082
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Here, here.

550
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,523
I mean, why not?
More and more of our experiences..

551
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,963
..are going to take place
in the virtual world, you know?

552
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,045
You're a writer. How are you gonna feel
when a computer can write a book..

553
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,885
..better than <b>War and Peace?/</b>
It'll never happen.

554
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,010
It's only a question
about when it's going to happen.

555
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,250
I think I'm gonna feel about it the same
way Kasparov felt when they could..

556
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,449
..no longer compete with that computer/
Big Blue.

557
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,365
Right. Nobody thought a computer
could beat our best.

558
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,127
"A machine lacks
that ineffable human instinct."

559
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,244
And then.. You know,
and now we can't even compete.

560
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,081
I saw a documentary where they were
doing an experiment on a lab rat.

561
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,770
And he was wired up..

562
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,930
..and he could push a switch
and have an orgasm.

563
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,569
And so the scientists were sort of laughing
at this pathetic little creature..

564
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,810
..while it ignored his food and water
and didn't do anything else.

565
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,684
And eventually it just died.

566
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,247
I mean,
I think that's the future of humanity.

567
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,766
You know, just,

568
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,123
And die.

569
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,408
Well, well, maybe so..

570
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,686
..but every generation believes that
they're witnessing the end of the world..

571
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,526
..but I feel that I'm actually living it.

572
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,248
Okay, I have a question for you, Patrick.
I think a lot of people are feeling that way.

573
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,842
That we're this kind of
pleasureobsessed, pornaddled..

574
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,328
..materialists,
ceding our humanity to technology..

575
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,649
..at the same moment
that computers are becoming sentient.

576
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,322
So, what my question is,
is this notion of self to begin with.

577
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Well, it's written over the portals
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

578
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,605
It says, <b>"gnothi seauton,"</b>
which means "Know thyself."

579
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
But we're kind of 99 percent
automated already.

580
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,563
No. Our personality
or this thing we think of as ourself..

581
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,326
..is a tiny fraction
of what the brain is doing.

582
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,802
Most of it is automated body functions.
What is it we're ceding?

583
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,886
No, if this notion of self is such
a small percentage of you, sweetie..

584
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,407
..how come I always hear
so much about it?

585
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,571
Well, just like my penis. It's not that big.
It's a small part of myself..

586
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,644
..but it needs a lot of attention/
His too.

587
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,283
And how did you two meet?

588
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,005
You don't know?/
What?

589
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,884
You have to read Jesse's books.

590
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,482
If you wanna know what it's like
to have sex with me, read away.

591
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,644
Read away/
Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.

592
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,968
No, no. I mean it's wellwritten.

593
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,527
Yeah/ Thank you.
We met about 18 years ago.

594
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,122
We kind of, sort of fell in love
a little bit, and then we..

595
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,888
A bit. Then we lost track of each other.
A decade later, we ran into each other.

596
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,407
We didn't run into each other/
We didn't?

597
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,285
No. You wrote a book "inspired"
by our meeting.

598
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,529
Yeah/
I read about it and went to look for him.

599
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,210
Pretty romantic/
It was.

600
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,051
Not really. Not really.
He neglects to mention..

601
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,402
..he was married, had a kid../
Details.

602
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,170
That part was a disaster.

603
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,408
It wasn't. It was inevitable/
Yeah.

604
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,291
The first time we have sex
without a condom, twins.

605
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,842
I've been chained to the sink ever since/
One pitch, tworun homer.

606
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,526
It's not that bad.
The girls are so beautiful.

607
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,643
They're cute.

608
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,365
Okay. No, no.
It has some upsides, okay.

609
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,245
Let me tell you right now, Anna,
how to keep a man.

610
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,525
You gotta let them win
at all the silly little games they like.

611
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,724
When I met Jesse, we were playing
pinball. I was winning.

612
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,121
The foundational lie to our relationship.

613
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,290
I let the ball go down the middle/
She can't beat me.

614
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,885
It builds their confidence.

615
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,011
If I didn't let him win at every game,
we would never have sex.

616
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,205
I mean, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's actually a closet macho.

617
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,448
He dreams of having a bimbo
for a wife.

618
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,480
It's my greatest aspiration, a bimbo/
Dreams.

619
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,490
So..

620
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,684
Yes.

621
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,327
So you're a writer?

622
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,684
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

623
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,770
So you write, like, books?

624
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,407
I've written a few, sure. Sure, yeah.

625
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,208
I've never met a writer before.

626
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,086
No?/
You must be really smart.

627
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,848
You know, I can't even write
my own name sometimes when I'm tired.

628
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,128
What kind of books do you like?

629
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,604
Well, I like stories
with a meaning behind it.

630
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,724
Like a really beautiful love story/
Oh, sure, yeah.

631
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,891
You know, I read this book once,
<b>Romeo and..</b>

632
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,371
<b>Juliet.</b>

633
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,684
Right?/
Yeah.

634
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,126
Oh, yeah/
You know it.

635
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,961
It's very good. It's a play, actually.
It's not a book, a play.

636
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,407
I thought it was a book
based on the movie.

637
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,642
No. No, a play. Yeah.

638
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,808
Okay, it was a play.

639
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,650
Well, I didn't read the whole thing
because sometimes..

640
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,326
..I have to keep up
and read those magazines..

641
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,205
..to know what's going on
in those people's lives.

642
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,768
Well, that is important/
Okay, well, you're very, very smart.

643
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,329
And I bet you have a gigantic penis.

644
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,929
Why am I finding myself
so attracted to this woman?

645
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,488
For real!
And that's the funny part of it.

646
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,321
The notsofunny part
of the closet macho, okay..

647
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,844
..is today, after we dropped Henry off,
he tells me even though I have an offer..

648
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,844
..for an amazing job,
he wants me to move to Chicago.

649
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,370
That's not what I said. I missed him/
So we can babysit for his exwife.

650
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,488
I thought I was in a../
Hey, stop it.

651
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,041
It must have been hard
saying goodbye to Hank.

652
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,607
Yeah, of course/
He's such an amazing kid.

653
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,889
Tell him I miss my chess partner/
I will.

654
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,045
When Stefanos and I split up,
I'm getting full custody.

655
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,651
That's okay for a while..

656
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,925
..because me and my 20yearold girlfriend
will be a little bit preoccupied.

657
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,327
I love men/
And I love you.

658
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,648
Okay, I have a story
that my husband here loves.

659
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,970
Gonna tell you everything you need
to know about masculine and feminine.

660
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,247
Okay/
Okay, ready?

661
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,125
Yeah/
My mom used to be a nurse..

662
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,767
..so she was there when people
were coming out of their coma.

663
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,689
Listen/
I'm listening.

664
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,287
It's an interesting story/
I'm listening.

665
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,450
So she was the one to tell them:

666
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,089
"Hi. My name's Katerina.
You're coming out of a coma.

667
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,885
You've been in a really bad
automobile accident..

668
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,401
..but you're gonna be okay.

669
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,606
You're gonna be fine."
You know, stuff like that.

670
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,361
She said that every woman,
the very first thing..

671
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,531
..the first reaction she would have,
would be to ask about everyone else.

672
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,411
"How are my kids?
How's my husband?

673
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,525
Is anyone else hurt?"

674
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,090
Every man, with no exception,
when they were told this..

675
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,045
..what was the first thing they did?

676
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,480
Look down at their cock.

677
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,610
You know what?
You gotta make sure it's still there.

678
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,888
You gotta make sure it's still working.

679
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,048
Alive and kicking/
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,087
And only eventually they'd come around
to asking about their kids..

681
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,409
..or about someone else
they might've accidentally killed.

682
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,681
Stuff like that.

683
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,282
Doesn't that say it all?
Penis first, then the rest of the world.

684
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,005
<b>Penis, penis, penis</b>

685
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,730
Okay, okay.

686
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,924
But if you can explain it all
on strictly gender terms..

687
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,642
..why do you, or why does any woman,
waste time getting mad at..

688
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,050
..or bother trying to change a man?/
If it's all biology, what is the problem?

689
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,720
And you're so good
at turning things around.

690
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,681
No, I mean, like, he's a genius/
It's like getting pissed at a frog..

691
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,042
..for being green/
Yes. Exactly.

692
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,768
Hearing all this, I wonder if this idea
of love affair that lasts forever..

693
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,405
..is still relevant to us.

694
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,122
I mean, we know that we are going
to break up eventually.

695
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,926
Definitely/
Are your parents still together?

696
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,849
No way/
No? And what about you?

697
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,930
They are. But they could be divorced/
They could be.

698
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,607
I think if they had more money,
they wouldn't still be together.

699
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,328
God, you guys are so practical.
I was born into the wrong generation.

700
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,842
My grandmother's mother
wrote to our whole family..

701
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,970
..a 26page letter
from her deathbed.

702
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,642
And she spent three pages
on the costumes she did for a play..

703
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,963
..and one paragraph on her husband/
She an actress too?

704
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,049
No, she was a..

705
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,044
She was a..

706
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,170
Seamstress. A seamstress/
Seamstress.

707
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,647
And she had
all these wonderful friends.

708
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,811
And about my greatgrandfather,
she mentioned three events.

709
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,447
He went to the war, we moved
because of his job, and he died.

710
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,680
Her big advice was to not to be
too consumed with romantic love.

711
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,930
Friendships and work, she said,
brought her the most happiness.

712
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,565
I couldn't agree more.

713
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,127
I mean,
that's the thing that fucks us up.

714
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,564
This idea of a soul mate, of someone
who will come to complete us..

715
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,128
..and save us
from having to take care of ourselves.

716
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,483
With Stefanos,
I set the bar extremely low.

717
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,007
I know he's not gonna meet
any of my needs.

718
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,531
Definitely not.

719
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,728
What about Grandma?
Was she soul mate?

720
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,209
Well, sounds appealing, but actually your
grandmother was more rational than that.

721
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,210
She took care of herself
and asked me to do the same.

722
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,727
We had plenty of room
to meet in the middle.

723
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,810
Yeah. That sounds ideal/
That is, actually. It is.

724
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,571
But it must be obvious
my wife is not here today.

725
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,560
We were never one person. Always two.
We preferred it that way.

726
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,088
That's so beautiful.

727
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,365
I think my husband is always trying
to almost colonize me, you know?

728
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,690
I colonize you?

729
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,005
Yes, but I colonize you too, darling/
Okay.

730
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,804
But at the end of the day..

731
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,609
..it's not the love of one other person
that matters, it's the love of life.

732
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,531
That's good to know,
because life, I can handle.

733
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,520
Ariadni, on the other hand.
We all know the Greeks invented tragedy.

734
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,451
And on top of that,
she's from the region of Mani..

735
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,563
..which is short for maniac.

736
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,921
Ask them about the hotel.

737
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,727
If we can't make that hotel room tonight,
could you get a refund or use it yourself?

738
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,527
No, we don't get a refund, man/
Are you trying to get out of it?

739
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,769
It's such a great gift,
but I'm so stressed..

740
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,128
..getting all the packing ready../
No.

741
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,563
We made a deal, guys.
We watch the kids. You're gonna love it.

742
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,808
We're gonna watch yours/
Really good.

743
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,607
It's a fantastic walk to the hotel.
And you want to grab it.

744
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,087
And we'll be very offended
if you don't go.

745
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,123
Okay. Thank you.

746
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,203
You're going.

747
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,968
Well, when I think of Elias..

748
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,925
..what I miss the most about him..

749
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,408
..is the way he used to lie down
next to me at night.

750
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,650
Sometimes his arm would stretch
along my chest.

751
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:52,131
And I couldn't move.
I even held my breath.

752
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,402
But I felt safe.

753
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,249
Complete.

754
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,768
And I miss the way he was whistling
walking down the street.

755
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,169
And every time I do something,
I think of what he would say:

756
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,682
"it's cold today. Wear a scarf."

757
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,087
But lately,
I've been forgetting little things.

758
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,207
He's sort of fading,
and I'm starting to forget him..

759
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,446
..and it's like losing him again.

760
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,522
So sometimes, I make myself remember
every detail of his face.

761
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,009
The exact color of his eyes,
his lips, his teeth..

762
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,602
..the texture of his skin, his hair.

763
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,569
That was all gone by the time he went.

764
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,845
And sometimes.. Not always.

765
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,650
But sometimes..

766
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,968
..I can actually see him.

767
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,970
It's as if a cloud moves away
and there he is.

768
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,650
I could almost touch him.

769
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:02,041
But then the real world rushes in,
and he vanishes again.

770
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,480
For a while, I did this every morning..

771
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,967
..when the sun
was not too bright outside.

772
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,886
The sun somehow makes him vanish.

773
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,011
Yes, he appears and he disappears,
like a sunrise or sunset.

774
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,443
Anything so ephemeral.

775
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,328
Just like our life.

776
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,206
We appear and we disappear.

777
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,609
And we are so important to some..

778
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,448
..but we are just passing through.

779
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,604
To passing through/
To passing through.

780
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,201
To passing through/
To passing through.

781
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,607
And eventually he catches his face
in the window's reflection.

782
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,280
He realizes he's no longer
a 9yearold boy.

783
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,484
He's suddenly old.
He's got a beard, his eyes are watery.

784
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,321
This one seems sad. I thought
you were gonna tell me about the guy..

785
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,887
..that has an imaginary friend/
Which one?

786
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,241
When he's in his 50's.

787
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
Imaginary friend shows up again/
Hummingbird?

788
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,805
That one. It's funny/
Yeah. You like that one?

789
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,731
Remember that letter
that you let me read..

790
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,685
..that you wrote when you were 20
to yourself at 40?

791
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,327
I remember. "Dear 40yearold Jesse,
I hope you're not divorced."

792
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,366
I didn't remember that part. I meant
all the other things in that letter.

793
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,641
You're the same guy.

794
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,401
We always think we're evolving,
but we can't change that much.

795
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,040
Know how I think I've changed
the most?/ How?

796
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,885
When I was younger,
I just wanted time to speed up.

797
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,849
Why?/
So I could be on my own..

798
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,646
..be freed from parents, school,
all that shit.

799
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,009
I just wanted to close my eyes
and wake up and be an adult.

800
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,682
Now I feel that happened,
and I just want everything to slow down.

801
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,282
I've always had this feeling
no matter where I am in my life..

802
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,161
..that it's either a memory or a dream/
You've always thought that.

803
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,564
Me too. Like, is this really my life?
Like, is it happening right now?

804
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,524
It is/ I know.

805
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,281
Every year, I seem to get a bit
more humbled and more overwhelmed..

806
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,165
..about things I'm never gonna know
or understand.

807
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,807
I keep telling you, you know nothing/
I know. I'm coming around.

808
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,724
But not knowing is not so bad.

809
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,091
I mean, the point is to be looking,
searching, to stay hungry, right?

810
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,851
It's true.
I just wish it was a little easier.

811
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,326
How do you mean?

812
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,410
Just to maintain a certain level
of passion, you know?

813
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,887
I mean, it used to come
so naturally.

814
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,801
I remember when I was younger,
me and all my writer friends, we, like..

815
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,482
It felt like we were doing something
important. This was our time.

816
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,047
But you were all arrogant little pricks.

817
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,089
No. Well.. All right, maybe.

818
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,802
I don't know. It grew out
of all this energy and this creativity..

819
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,002
..or whatever ambitions people had.

820
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,131
I think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated.

821
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,369
Young men have this thing
about comparing themselves.

822
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,689
They have all these signposts
they judge themself by.

823
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,207
You used to do that all the time/
Do what?

824
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,880
It was like "Rimbaud wrote this by 17."

825
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,329
Oh, yeah, definitely. Balzac wrote a book
before breakfast, so, what am I doing?

826
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,524
Women don't think that way as much/
You don't think so?

827
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,491
No. We have much less
to compare ourselves to maybe.

828
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,089
Women who achieve anything, first time
you hear about them, they're in their 50s.

829
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,443
It was so hard for them
to get any recognitions before then.

830
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,849
They struggled for 30 years
or they raised kids..

831
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,886
..and were stranded at home before
they could finally do what they want.

832
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,125
Actually, you know, it's kind of freeing.
We don't have to spend our lives..

833
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,887
..comparing ourselves
to Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Tolstoy.

834
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,690
What about Joan of Arc, right?

835
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,889
I mean, she was a teenager,
and she saved France, so..

836
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,447
Who wants to be Joan of Arc?
Forget France.

837
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,769
She was burned at the stake
and a virgin, okay?

838
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,405
Okay/
Nothing I aspire to.

839
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,523
What a great achievement.

840
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,410
Oh, God/
What?

841
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,841
No, nothing.

842
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,327
What?/
This is so weird.

843
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,882
What do you mean?/
Just this.

844
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,970
Us, walking, having a conversation..

845
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,925
..about something else
than scheduling, food, work.

846
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,920
Yeah, how long's it been since
we just wandered around bullshitting?

847
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,888
Do you hear what I hear?

848
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,403
The sea?/ No.

849
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,365
What? Oh, no small feet.

850
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,042
No.. Nothing being knocked over,
nothing we have to clean up..

851
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,049
..no injustices being done.

852
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,005
Yeah. So when was the last time?

853
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,810
When we had nowhere
we had to be?/ Yeah.

854
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,727
Remember Luxembourg Gardens?/
Yeah.

855
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,764
Used to kick your ass at PingPong?/
Congratulations.

856
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,843
You beat a woman pregnant
with twins.

857
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,890
It's better than losing
to a pregnant woman with twins.

858
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,883
Okay?/
Oh, God.

859
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,925
You know what I think?

860
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,051
From the time we leave
our parents' house until we have kids.

861
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,124
That's the only time your life
is completely your own.

862
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,607
I had about a decade of that.
It was great.

863
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,007
It was just like one long flowing..

864
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,049
A day, a week, a year.

865
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,403
There wasn't much difference/
I used to keep track of time.

866
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,565
Through jobs, boyfriends, stuff like that.
Now I can tell you every detail..

867
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,685
..of the past seven years based on what
was happening in the girls' lives.

868
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,684
Yeah, right. Totally/
You do that too?

869
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,491
Yeah. I mean, time's demarcated now/
Really?

870
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,444
What?/
No, no, no. No, I just..

871
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,281
I'm surprised. I'm surprised you do that.
No, but.. Okay, quick test.

872
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,761
Oh, no/
You know, August, 2009.

873
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,083
No, August..
Come on. It's a quick one/ Why?

874
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,243
What was happening?/
August..

875
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,402
We were on vacation
with your parents.

876
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,643
Nina got the chicken pox first,
quickly followed by Ella.

877
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,764
I'm so impressed/
So do I get a gold star?

878
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,490
Maybe.

879
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,366
Hey, can I ask you a question?/
Sure.

880
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,043
If we were meeting for the first time today
on a train, would you find me attractive?

881
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,050
Of course/
No, but really, right now, as I am?

882
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,481
Would you start talking to me?

883
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,246
Would you ask me
to get off the train with you?

884
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,643
Well, I mean,
you're asking a theoretical question.

885
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,561
What would my life situation be?
Wouldn't I be cheating on you?

886
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,603
Why can't you just say yes?/
I did.

887
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,770
I wanted you to say something
romantic and you blew it.

888
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,930
Okay, all right, wait,
if I saw you on a train..

889
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,686
..I would lock eyes with you,
walk up to you..

890
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,126
..and say, "Hey, baby.

891
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,602
You are making me as horny
as a billy goat in a pepper patch."

892
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,882
Stop it! That's disgusting!

893
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,290
Billy goat? No.
The truth is, okay, you failed the test.

894
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,051
The fact is,
you would not pick me up on a train.

895
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,720
Would not notice
a fatassed middleaged mom..

896
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,321
..losing her hair/
Okay. Losing..

897
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,127
Yeah, that's me.

898
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,607
You set me up to fail on this one.

899
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,167
Okay, true, true, true/
You did. All right.

900
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,769
But in the real world, baldy, okay,
on game day when it mattered..

901
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,284
..I did talk to you on a train, okay?
I did. It was the best thing I ever did.

902
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,209
Really? Look at the goats/
Hey.

903
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,243
Hello/
Yeah.

904
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,285
But, you know,
that's not even a good question.

905
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,724
The real question would be,
if I did ask you to get off a train..

906
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,883
Yeah?/
..would you get off with me?

907
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,367
Of course not.
I have people waiting for me.

908
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,282
You know, and a 41yearold,
horny billy goat.

909
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,121
How creepy.
I'm creeped out right now. Help!

910
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,288
I can't believe I'm 41.

911
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,841
Yeah, me neither.
You've gotten so old.

912
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,441
I never thought I'd sleep
with anyone over 40.

913
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,405
Actually, you're the oldest guy
I've ever slept with.

914
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,922
That's something.
I'm not the oldest guy you've ever blown.

915
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,451
What?

916
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,166
That conference in Warsaw.

917
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,721
What conference?/
Lech Walesa.

918
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,524
Lech Walesa?

919
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,762
What are you talking about?/
It's okay.

920
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,930
It was before we were together.
It's.. You can admit it.

921
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,409
I can remember the way you talked
about how he opened your heart.

922
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,286
You definitely blew him. Definitely/
Oh, okay. You're really crazy.

923
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,802
That was Gorbachev, okay,
you geographicallychallenged..

924
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,527
..footballobsessed, doughnutloving
American. That was Gorbachev.

925
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,768
I got my Eastern bloc leaders
mixed up.

926
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,121
And I didn't blow him.

927
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,971
At all. Okay? Take it back/
Okay, okay, okay.

928
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,730
God.

929
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,848
So was it Vaclav Havel?

930
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,281
All right, you know..

931
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,088
Listen to this. I was gonna wait
to tell you this till later..

932
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,328
..but I'm so bad with secrets.

933
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,682
You have a tumor in your brain?
Gonna die?

934
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,201
No, no, no. Nothing like that. All right?

935
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,204
Well, actually, it's kind of like that.

936
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,166
My grandmother died.

937
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,569
What? When?/
Yeah. My dad texted me before we ate.

938
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,802
I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?

939
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,681
Everybody's been expecting it.
She lived a long time, had a great life.

940
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,524
She was 96.

941
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,365
Didn't live much longer
after your grandfather died?

942
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,721
Barely a year.

943
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,441
I mean, the funny thing is,
this woman was a freaking saint. Okay?

944
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,604
She was a nurse in the war.
She took care of all of us.

945
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,849
I mean, she never said an unkind word
about anybody.

946
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,849
I wish I'd met her/
It's okay.

947
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,011
It's okay. By the end, she just really
wasn't into meeting new people.

948
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,602
I mean, after a lifetime
of being sweet as pie..

949
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,610
..once Grandpa died,
she got kind of ornery.

950
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,842
It happens. She was in mourning, no?

951
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,965
Well, my dad said
she was just waiting to die.

952
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,130
How long were they married?/
Seventyfour years.

953
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,767
Fuck. How is that even possible?

954
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,246
I know.

955
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,286
How old will we be
if we are together 74 years?

956
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,409
When would we start counting from?

957
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,730
I guess from the first time we had sex/
Okay. Yeah, good.

958
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,003
Okay/
So 1994.

959
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,846
Okay, '94.

960
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,643
Fiftysix years from now/
Yeah. We will be 98.

961
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,162
Will you be able to put up with me
for another 56 more years?

962
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,125
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to put up with you.

963
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,886
It's crazy if you think
about the change they saw.

964
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,486
When they met,
neither of them had electricity.

965
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,887
He used to take her to school
on his horse.

966
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,366
So romantic/
I know.

967
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,967
He was Valedictorian
and she was salutatorian.

968
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,207
What is that?

969
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,488
He was top of the class.
She was second.

970
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,326
She got a couple answers wrong
to make sure he didn't feel threatened.

971
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,121
If she wanted to get laid, she
better have/ Yeah, like you know who.

972
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,770
All right. Anyway, so I called my dad after
I got the text, just to tell him I was sorry..

973
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,485
..but I think I screwed up.

974
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,251
At some point I told him,
"You're an orphan now."

975
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,761
You know,
and he didn't think that was funny.

976
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,440
No, it's not funny at all/
Yeah, I guess not.

977
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,204
He's next, then you/
I know.

978
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,041
Well, he told me that my grandparents
wanna have a joint service.

979
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,046
Right? They wanna have their ashes
intermingled and be buried as one.

980
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,009
Grandfather didn't have a funeral?

981
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,731
They vowed never to attend
one another's funeral.

982
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,086
Oh, yeah.

983
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,050
I kind of like the idea
of you attending mine.

984
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,447
What?/
No, I know.

985
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,246
What?/
..You know, imagining you in a suit..

986
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,927
..cleanshaven for once,
holding hands with the girls. I like it.

987
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,451
You're gonna outlive me.

988
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,962
Well, we'll see.
Or I guess, one of us will see.

989
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,331
Well, you think you wanna go
to the service with me?

990
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,729
To Texas?/
It's not gonna be in Paris.

991
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,962
Okay. How bad do you want me there?

992
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,606
I'd come,
but it's expensive with the flights.

993
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,286
Truth is, it'd be simpler to go alone.

994
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,164
Oh, hello/
Yeah, hello, buddy.

995
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,887
And if I'm not there, it'll be
easier for you to fuck your cousins.

996
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,320
Yes, that's true/
Yeah.

997
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,847
Isn't that common
where you come from?

998
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,566
You didn't answer the question/
What question?

999
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,651
Well, will you be able to put up with me
for another 56 more years?

1000
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,365
I am looking forward to it.

1001
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,210
Shit, you're really working it.

1002
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,048
The nectar of your sex
ages like a fine wine.

1003
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,489
My hairy Spanish lover is back.

1004
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,126
Greek. I'm Greek now/
Oh, you're Greek now.

1005
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,129
Look at this.

1006
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,562
This place reminds me of a movie
I saw when I was a teenager.

1007
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,366
It was a blackandwhite film
from the '50s.

1008
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,603
I remember a couple walking
through the ruins of Pompeii..

1009
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,406
..looking at bodies
lying there for centuries.

1010
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,080
I remember the bodies,
caught in their sleep..

1011
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,806
..still lovingly holding each other.

1012
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,443
I don't know why. Sometimes
I have this image in my mind..

1013
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,120
..when, you know, we're asleep
and you hold me.

1014
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,325
Of being buried alive under molten ash?
That's what you're thinking about?

1015
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,851
That's not very fun.

1016
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,884
Well, I don't know. It's not horrible.

1017
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,123
They had bodies
with little kids sleeping between them.

1018
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,526
Oh, that's nice/
Yeah.

1019
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,370
I was young and a bit morbid.

1020
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,603
You romanticize the idea of dying
with the person you love.

1021
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,364
You wanna die with me?/
Right?

1022
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,881
Maybe. You know, if we were..

1023
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,607
You know, our first night together then,
a long time ago..

1024
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,529
..but now, no, I'd like to live.

1025
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,405
I wanted you to say something romantic.
You blew it.

1026
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,404
Oh, no. I blew it.

1027
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,967
Okay, if we're both 98,
you can ask me again.

1028
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,242
But anytime sooner:

1029
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,525
Sorry/
Hey.

1030
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,127
This is the chapel I was telling you about
from the Byzantine era.

1031
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,129
It's 1000 years old/
Can we go in?

1032
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,527
Yeah, I think so/
Okay.

1033
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,609
Check this out.

1034
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,246
Hello? Yeah.

1035
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,524
It's a shrine to Saint Odilia,
the patron saint to eyesight.

1036
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,968
People come from all over,
leave dedications to the blind..

1037
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,441
..to help restore sight.

1038
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,051
I'm sure it works.

1039
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,964
Hey, these paintings here..

1040
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,609
..they make me think of those Japanese
monks, you know, impermanence.

1041
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,007
They paint with water
on rock on a hot day.

1042
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,606
By the time they're done,
it's evaporated.

1043
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,851
Eyes are scratched out.
Is that about the blindness?

1044
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,646
No, I thought that too,
but the caretaker guy..

1045
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,162
..he told me that the Turks did that
during the occupation.

1046
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,767
That's it.
I'm never eating Turkish food again.

1047
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,362
Okay, that'll send a shiver
through the international community.

1048
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,689
Okay, fine. Then I'll never suck
another Turkish cock.

1049
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,562
Okay,
that's gonna have a global impact.

1050
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,205
Oh, that's terrible.

1051
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,564
I forgot you're a closet Christian. Is it
bad to make blowjob jokes in church?

1052
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,369
It kind of is, okay? We've done worse.

1053
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,371
The girls asked me again
what our wedding was like.

1054
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,965
Yeah? What did you say?

1055
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,970
I say it was very low key/
Yeah.

1056
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,561
Very low key.
So low key we don't remember it.

1057
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,125
Very Quaker.

1058
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,490
I don't know why they want us to be
married so badly. It's important to them.

1059
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,650
We're in a church.
Wanna get married?/ No.

1060
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,407
It's just all those fairy tales
they like so much, you know?

1061
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,929
Remember when they were little..

1062
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,126
..and at the end of every cartoon, they'd
be like, "They're getting married"..

1063
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,326
..even if it was Pinocchio and his dad,
Donald Duck and his nephews.

1064
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,167
If we're gonna spend
56 more years together..

1065
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,250
Yeah?/
..what about me would you change?

1066
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,968
What?/
One of your can'twin questions.

1067
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,361
I'm not answering that/
What do you mean?

1068
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,251
There's not one thing
you'd like to change about me?

1069
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,607
I'm perfect? Okay/
Okay, actually..

1070
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,610
One thing/
If I could change one thing about you..

1071
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,441
..it would be for you
to stop trying to change me.

1072
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,449
You're a very skilled manipulator.

1073
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,962
Well, I am on to you.
I know how you work.

1074
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,083
You think?/
I know everything about you.

1075
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,011
Let's go through here/
I don't think you do.

1076
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,525
No? Okay. Well, I know you better
than I know anybody else on the planet.

1077
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,240
But maybe that's not saying much/
Right now..

1078
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,171
What?/
..this is great. I feel close to you.

1079
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,805
Yeah/
But sometimes..

1080
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,368
..I feel like you're breathing helium
and I'm breathing oxygen.

1081
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,160
What makes you say that?

1082
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,006
See? I'm trying to connect../
I'm being myself.

1083
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,208
..and you make a joke.

1084
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,886
That's exactly what I'm talking about/
Come on.

1085
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,441
If we're ever gonna truly know
one another..

1086
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,928
..we'd probably have to get
to know ourselves better first.

1087
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,165
Yeah.

1088
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,241
Do you remember this friend of mine,
George, from New York?

1089
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,566
No.

1090
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,882
Oh, no, that was before/
What was?

1091
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,401
No, no.
Anyway, he was this friend of mine..

1092
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,321
..that when he found out he had
leukemia and was probably gonna die..

1093
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,444
..the first thing that came to his mind
was relief.

1094
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,051
Relief? At what?/
Yeah.

1095
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,404
Before he found out he had nine months
to live, he was worried about money.

1096
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,401
And now his thought was, "I have enough
money to live nine months. I've made it."

1097
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,045
Oh, okay/
I mean..

1098
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,127
He was finally able to enjoy everything
about life, even being stuck in traffic.

1099
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,609
He would just enjoy looking at people,
staring at their faces, just little things.

1100
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,529
And then what happened?

1101
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,006
What do you mean?

1102
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,043
Well, like, is he still alive?

1103
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,891
No, he died a long time ago.

1104
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,168
Last night, I had this dream
where I was reading a book.

1105
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,806
Okay. It was a lost classic.
The Rovers.

1106
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,480
The Rovers?/
Like roving around, wandering.

1107
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,166
All these young people/
Is that a real book?

1108
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,490
No, but it was great. it was fresh, funny,
experimental, had all this energy.

1109
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,968
I love that you read in your dreams/
And they're really good.

1110
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,242
I have, like, major actionhero dreams.

1111
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,241
Like I'm flying around like a superhero,
breaking through walls.

1112
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,041
And at the end, I have an orgasm.

1113
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,528
Well, I'm gonna try
to make your dreams come true, baby.

1114
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,609
Still there.

1115
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,529
Still there.

1116
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,969
Still there.

1117
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,163
Still there.

1118
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,045
Gone.

1119
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,850
I need your credit card.

1120
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,644
I think the room is paid for.

1121
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,845
Yeah/ Yes, it is,
but the credit card is for..

1122
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,361
..for all possible outcomes/
Incidentals.

1123
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,641
Right. Of course.

1124
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,966
Mr. Wallace?/
Yeah.

1125
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,367
I am such a fan of these two books.

1126
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,761
My husband gave me your book
on our date..

1127
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,481
..and when your second book came out,
we read it out loud together.

1128
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,802
Would you please sign them to us?/
Of course. Of course.

1129
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,561
I love the artwork on these
Greek editions. It's really nice.

1130
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,881
What are your names?/
Make it to Sophia and Pavlos.

1131
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,730
Okay.

1132
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,289
How's the Greek translation?

1133
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,010
Well, it's called:

1134
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,170
But I'm not sure it's the correct word/
You never read them in English.

1135
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,765
Exactly.

1136
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,571
That's great.

1137
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,000
Could you sign them too?

1138
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,325
Me?/
Yes, you're the real Madeleine, right?

1139
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,324
Madeleine? Not really.

1140
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,444
I mean, people assume it's me,
but it's not me at all.

1141
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,449
He's got a big imagination.

1142
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,249
Would you be so kind?
It would mean so much to my husband.

1143
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,646
I can't sign a book I didn't write. it../
She'd be happy to.

1144
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,604
Okay/
Great. Thank you.

1145
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,689
I'm happy to.

1146
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,641
Thank you.

1147
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,082
Okay/
Great. Thank you so much.

1148
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,401
Check it out.

1149
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,602
This is nice/
Yeah.

1150
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,406
Clean, air conditioning.

1151
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,206
I love it. Oh, my God/
Isn't it great?

1152
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,164
A bathtub. My God.

1153
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,010
Hey, check this out.

1154
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,967
Stefanos and Ariadni got us
a bottle of wine and a couple's massage.

1155
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,686
We have to get them a present
before we leave.

1156
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,885
We should get something for the kids/
Yeah, I know, for sure.

1157
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,288
Oh, I miss the girls.

1158
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,527
I don't.

1159
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,087
This is such a nice view.

1160
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,245
The only view that I am interested in..

1161
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:08,282
What? What?/
..ls right here.

1162
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,124
Yeah. It's this.

1163
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,930
What?

1164
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,881
It's funny, I never noticed until today,
but all the red in your beard is gone.

1165
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,006
It used to be one of the things
that made me fall for you. It's crazy.

1166
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,088
It's not gone. It's just white.

1167
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,126
You're not gonna tell me that your love
is dependent on pigment, are you?

1168
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,563
Huh? No?/
No, no, but, you know..

1169
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,961
..I see the red in our girls' eye lashes.

1170
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,801
I look at them
and it makes me think of when we met.

1171
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,209
Know what I'm looking forward to..

1172
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,567
Yeah? What?/
..after..

1173
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,240
After?/
..you know?

1174
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,123
What?/
Ls waking up next to you tomorrow.

1175
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,170
You mean, without Nina and Ella
jumping on our heads?

1176
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,049
Exactly.

1177
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,086
I haven't heard you think in years now.

1178
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,442
Think?/
Yeah.

1179
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,487
I used to wake up to that sound
of your eyes opening and closing.

1180
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,366
That brain of yours
going 2 million miles an hour.

1181
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,485
I miss it, hearing you think.

1182
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,403
When you said you could hear me think,
I thought you could.

1183
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,803
But it's just my eyelids.
How dumb and romantic of me.

1184
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,241
It was my favorite thing.

1185
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,126
I miss thinking too.

1186
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,964
No more thinking in the morning,
no more morning sex.

1187
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,248
Tomorrow.

1188
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,200
I'm looking forward to it so much,
I don't think I will sleep.

1189
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,724
I'm looking forward to right now.

1190
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,280
Okay.

1191
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:22,281
Okay, let's stop talking
so we can fuck..

1192
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,930
..sleep, wake up, think,
and fuck again.

1193
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,480
Don't answer it/
No.

1194
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,920
Oh, shit, who is it? No.

1195
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,088
Who cares?/
Okay.

1196
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,767
I said to call in case of emergency only.
I hope the girls are okay.

1197
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,851
Okay.

1198
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,321
Oh, it's Henry. Okay.

1199
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,488
Hey, sweetie, are you okay?

1200
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,769
Are you in London?

1201
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,650
Already? Okay.

1202
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,971
Oh, no, no, we found it.

1203
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,648
We'll mail it tomorrow. Don't worry.
Yeah, yeah.

1204
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,723
Yeah. Oh, they miss you too.
I'll kiss them for you.

1205
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,609
Yeah.

1206
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,763
Okay, I'll tell him.

1207
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,246
Good luck with your mom.

1208
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,920
Yeah. I love you too. Bye.

1209
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,764
Okay.

1210
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,886
Okay.

1211
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,488
He's fine. He says he'll call you
from Chicago when he lands.

1212
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,331
Why can't I talk to him?
Twice you've done that.

1213
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,602
You could have just
handed me the phone.

1214
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,962
He didn't have time.
They were boarding.

1215
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,446
What did he forget?

1216
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,201
His science project.
But we'll mail it tomorrow. It'll be fine.

1217
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,482
Shouldn't have said that
about his mom.

1218
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,803
What? What did I say?/
"Good luck with your mom."

1219
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,207
Come on/
I didn't mean anything by it.

1220
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,530
I know, but it's not good. It reminds him.
And I wish you wouldn't do that.

1221
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,123
That's so American to just swipe it under
the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.

1222
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,805
Why put it into his head?

1223
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,049
What if he doesn't wanna be thinking
about that right now?

1224
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,250
It means nothing/
It means something. It does.

1225
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,090
I made a joke the other day..

1226
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,046
..that his mom and I should settle it
in one big mud wrestling contest.

1227
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,971
Mud wrestling? You said that?/
And he laughed.

1228
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,562
He might have more of a sense of humor
than you do. Come on.

1229
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,124
You say bad things about his morn,
he hears bad things about himself.

1230
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,689
I didn't say anything bad about his mom.
I made a joke. It's on me as it is on her.

1231
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,169
I know, I know. It's just,
why conjure it up at all, you know?

1232
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,885
I think he's old enough now.

1233
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,448
I mean, he knows how bad it is
between his mother and I.

1234
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,008
His mom and me/
And I didn't do anything. It's all from her.

1235
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,722
Okay, she hates me. Yes,
I fucked her husband a long time ago.

1236
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,684
Or should I say he fucked me?

1237
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,924
Yeah, right/
Okay.

1238
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,960
Making a joke that his mom and I
don't love each other is not the issue.

1239
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,964
That's not gonna traumatize him.
That already happened.

1240
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,124
And now you're trying
to transfer your guilt and blame me.

1241
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,327
No, I'm not.

1242
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:11,082
On the contrary, if he can joke about it,
maybe he'll be able to live with it better.

1243
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,161
Okay, you're right, as always.
Let's just not talk about it, okay?

1244
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,370
Right. It's nobody's fault if his mom
is a drunk and abusive psychologically.

1245
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,443
Don't say that.

1246
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,887
It makes me sick
that he has to be with her.

1247
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,924
But judges assume
that women have the mother instinct.

1248
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,851
She has the mother instinct of Medea.

1249
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,445
Medea, huh?

1250
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,768
Yeah. After all, it is a Greek myth.

1251
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,883
Actually a play by Euripides, but..

1252
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,771
A woman killing her kids
to punish her exhusband.

1253
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,651
That's what she's doing.
Hurting him to get to you.

1254
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,521
No, she's making my life hell
through him, that's what she's doing.

1255
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,203
And sometimes you say things
that just go too far.

1256
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,165
Stop blaming me
for everything wrong with your wife.

1257
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,046
Exwife, exwife.
For a long time/ Okay.

1258
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,130
Should have dealt with it.
She wouldn't have hated us.

1259
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,527
Okay, okay, I screwed up.

1260
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,560
I just love this little rewrite you do..

1261
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,448
..that everything that isn't perfect
in our life gets laid at my feet.

1262
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,765
And now you're putting this shit on me
about Henry.

1263
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,122
What shit?
What are you talking about?

1264
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,724
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.
The moving to Chicago, giving up my life.

1265
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,884
You mentioned that Henry needs you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

1266
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,003
I'm miserable. All right?

1267
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,248
How can I take that job now?/
Okay.

1268
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,364
Tell me. I'll feel too guilty.
No, no, no/ Come here.

1269
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,042
That's a choice you're making,
to look at it like that. All right?

1270
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,323
It is in the nature of women
to be the nurturer.

1271
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,449
The what?/
The nurturer.

1272
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,723
The nurturer?/
Okay, I can't even say that fucking word.

1273
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,642
I just naturally feel bad about everything.
And you give that look, like it's my fault.

1274
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,684
What look?/
The Iforgotthescienceproject look.

1275
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,247
I know you blame me/
I didn't say anything.

1276
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,161
No, you didn't say anything.
You didn't have to. It's always my fault.

1277
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,249
Yeah, right.

1278
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,482
I read on the fridge at work..

1279
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,651
You know those magnet words
that people make sentences with?

1280
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,568
Someone had put together,
"Women explore for eternity..

1281
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,802
..in the vast garden of sacrifice."

1282
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,808
That's a sure sign from God/
Yeah.

1283
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,164
That line is so damn true, and it's been
for 10,000 years, but that's enough.

1284
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,289
I don't wanna be one of these women.

1285
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,127
Like marriage is important to gays,
or contraception to women rights.

1286
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,763
It's the same with giving up my hopes,
with women that had to give up hopes.

1287
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,885
I'm not gonna do it. This is bigger
than me. This means more than me.

1288
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,730
Bravo.
The Nobel Committee is taking note.

1289
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,884
I'm just.. Hold on a second.
I'm gonna alert Sweden.

1290
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,527
It must be a fulltime job
carrying that much feminine oppression.

1291
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,683
It is/
You suffered so much..

1292
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,763
..growing up in middleclass Paris.

1293
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,606
The agony in the trenches of the
Sorbonne in the postfeminist era..

1294
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,842
..I can't imagine/
You're an asshole.

1295
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,523
You know what, sweetie,
when are we moving to Chicago?

1296
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,610
I wanna make sure
we are able to find a nice house..

1297
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,202
..and I can sew the drapes
and pick matching bed covers.

1298
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,165
This is how you now want
to be spending this evening?

1299
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,647
This is what you wanna do?/
You started it.

1300
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,561
No, you are the one
who will not shut up about it.

1301
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,923
But if you wanna talk about it,
really talk about it..

1302
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,205
..I would prefer to have an unemotional,
rational conversation.

1303
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,010
Do you think we could do that?

1304
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,044
Here we go, unemotional, rational.

1305
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,244
You always play the part
of the one and only rational one.

1306
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,961
And I'm the irrational, hysterical,
hormonecrazy one..

1307
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,605
..because I have emotions.

1308
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,531
You sit back
and speak from your big perspective..

1309
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,166
..which means
everything you say is true.

1310
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,890
I don't always do anything.

1311
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,801
The world is fucked by unemotional,
rational men deciding shit.

1312
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,449
Politicians going to war, corporate heads
deciding to wreck the environment.

1313
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,530
Cheney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.

1314
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,563
Cheney and Rumsfeld, yeah, okay.

1315
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,843
The Final Solution,
very rational thinking behind that.

1316
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,411
Okay. So we're there now?

1317
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,047
Us versus the Final Solution?
Okay. Let's do it. All right.

1318
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,083
Let me ask you this, all right?

1319
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,084
Do you think Henry's life
would be helped..

1320
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,760
..by a more consistent presence
by you and me?

1321
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,046
Here we go/
No.

1322
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,131
You won't drop it, so let's talk.
Let me just ask you one question.

1323
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,887
Think Hank's life
would be better served..

1324
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,202
..by consistent presence
from you and me?

1325
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,250
Yes, it'd be better if
he lived with us/ Okay.

1326
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,284
I think his mom
is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt..

1327
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,007
..that used the time we were in Paris
and I was giving birth..

1328
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,722
..to legally move Henry out of New York.
Fuck her.

1329
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,408
Okay. I agree with you.

1330
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,729
Okay. Unfortunately,
we cannot go get him out of America..

1331
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,566
..but we could, if we wanted to,
go to him.

1332
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,246
Now, I know it would be a big move.

1333
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,445
But what do you think? ls there any way
that you could be happy in the U.S.?

1334
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,288
Is that just out of the realm of possibility?
That you could find a comparable job?

1335
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,771
Comparable job?/
Yeah.

1336
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,331
Are you kidding?/
No.

1337
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,444
Why am I the one
that have to make the compromises?

1338
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,007
Don't be so dramatic. Okay?/
It should be..

1339
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,931
Moving to Chicago
is pretty fucking dramatic for me.

1340
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,330
I'm not saying we should move.
I just wanna talk about it.

1341
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,251
Can you be my friend for two seconds
so we can talk?

1342
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,680
Two seconds/
All right.

1343
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,844
Remember that time you were late
to pick the girls up..

1344
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,841
..and you were so stressed out because
they were wondering what happened?

1345
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,884
Okay, that is the way
that I feel all the time.

1346
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,165
Like I fucked up. I mean, I left him behind
and I just wanna go get him.

1347
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,005
You always get like this
when you drop him off.

1348
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,168
You're sad, so you start a fight.

1349
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,370
He's fine.

1350
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,490
He's a great kid, okay?

1351
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,251
Truth is, he doesn't need you
the way he used to.

1352
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,843
You missed the opportunity to be with
him every day of his childhood. You did.

1353
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,681
And you can cry about it,
but he's growing up.

1354
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,367
You're a great father in other ways.

1355
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,169
You got divorced like millions
of other people. Was it ideal? No. But..

1356
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,401
Listen, if in one month
you still want me to quit my job..

1357
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,082
..and give up everything
I've been working towards, just ask..

1358
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,847
..but right now
I feel the same way I always have.

1359
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:32,250
I would move to the U.S. if that exwife
of yours would give us joint custody.

1360
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,968
But every other weekend amounts to shit.
That's less than 30 days a semester.

1361
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,842
I don't think it's worth it for us to change
our entire lives over that kind of time.

1362
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,122
I know. You're right/
Right? Right?

1363
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,761
See, I'm being the rational one.

1364
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,880
Oh, it's just such a shitty position,
you know?

1365
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,806
Hank didn't do anything, but he's the one
getting kicked in the teeth.

1366
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,441
We all get dragged
through our parents' lives.

1367
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,644
Your marriage would have ended
over something else.

1368
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,451
Absolutely/
Or worse, he would've been raised..

1369
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,410
..by two miserable parents/
Right.

1370
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,207
I just really fucked that up.

1371
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,962
You mean, you fucked up by moving
to Paris to be with me?

1372
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,250
No. That's not what I meant. Stop/
I knew that was gonna cost too much.

1373
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,767
I told you not to do it, okay?/
Stop it.

1374
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:28,486
Okay, I moved to New York with you
for two years and gave up everything.

1375
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,365
I needed to be home
to give birth to the twins..

1376
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,530
..and I wanted to be with my mother.
You wanted it too.

1377
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,160
Yes/ That's the one thing
I asked from you.

1378
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,330
The one thing
and now you're gonna blame me forever?

1379
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,646
Stop it, will you? Stop it.

1380
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,205
If you don't wanna move back
to the States, we won't. End of story.

1381
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,209
I am just trying to find a way..

1382
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,443
..where I could be a more consistent
presence in his life.

1383
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,405
And ideally, I'd like to do that
as a family.

1384
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,481
"As a family"? Or what?

1385
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,483
What the fuck does that mean?

1386
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,890
I feel a passiveaggressive threat
in everything you say.

1387
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,802
Either do this or I will resent you
for the rest of our lives.

1388
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,570
You know?

1389
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,804
Am I right?

1390
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,642
You know what? You know what?
I'm sensing something.

1391
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,408
I think the problem is, is that you don't
want me to have a more substantial job.

1392
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,002
On some level, you feel threatened
by my achieving anything..

1393
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,044
..that could diminish your status
in our relationship.

1394
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,607
My status in our relationship?

1395
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,805
I teach two courses a semester
at the fucking American School.

1396
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,765
Okay. Wow, that's really some status.

1397
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,440
I don't think it's coincidence
you feel that..

1398
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,769
..at the same time
I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

1399
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,084
This whole train of thought
is complete horseshit and you know it.

1400
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,847
I have a question for you.

1401
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:02,120
If we didn't have the girls and all our
crap, would we even still be together?

1402
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,049
What?

1403
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,369
You are the fucking mayor of crazy town,
do you know that?

1404
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,201
You know what I think? You need
to move to Chicago. Henry needs you.

1405
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,971
I stay in Paris with the girls
and take this job.

1406
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,525
Why are you doing this?

1407
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,410
That is a ridiculous idea.

1408
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,884
I'm gonna lose you and the girls? No.
Why do you make everything so difficult?

1409
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,641
You're unhappy. You're blaming me
for taking you away from your son.

1410
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,491
That is a completely irrational
response..

1411
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,809
..to something I'm just trying
to feel my way through.

1412
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,007
Listen, Jesse,
we've just spent the last six weeks here..

1413
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,928
..and it's been great.

1414
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,082
You've been able to write every day
and the weather's been nice.

1415
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,251
But I didn't wanna come to Greece/
I know.

1416
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,171
All right?
There could be a revolution any second.

1417
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,489
Oh, God/
People eat a lot of feta and olive oil..

1418
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,765
..and they act all happy, but they
actually talk about how angry they are..

1419
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,884
..and it confuses me.
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1420
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,048
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1421
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,323
The same thing that always happens.

1422
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,562
Nothing.

1423
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,282
All right. Know what? I have had
absolutely zero time for myself.

1424
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,649
I have 10,000 emails I have to answer
that I didn't answer.

1425
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,966
You think I don't?

1426
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,647
I spend all day making dinner
and wiping you and your son's pee..

1427
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,842
..while you talk to fellow novelists.

1428
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:29,689
Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius.
Blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.

1429
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,886
The second we say goodbye to Henry,
you suggest I give up my dream job.

1430
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,889
Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?

1431
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,084
This afternoon
you weren't even sure you wanted it.

1432
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,089
Do you ever listen to yourself?

1433
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,643
It is my dream job. Just because I have
doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.

1434
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,251
Okay/
But why do you care?

1435
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,041
You go on your twohour
contemplative walk under the olive trees.

1436
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,481
Socrates. You should get a robe.

1437
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,320
It's an hour.

1438
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,047
By the time you leave
and by the time you're with us, two hours.

1439
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,441
I could never do that.

1440
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:05,929
You're good at taking care of yourself.
I take care of myself and everything else.

1441
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,925
We go, you pack your bag.
I pack everything else.

1442
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,482
You would never let me pack
the girls' shit. Never.

1443
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,047
There would be no shoes
and dirty underwear.

1444
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,565
Yeah, right, so says you.

1445
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,486
No, I'm happy you have time
to contemplate the universe..

1446
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,246
..because I don't.
I barely have time to think.

1447
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,522
I work, I babysit, I work, I babysit.

1448
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,566
Could you hold on a second?
I just have to tune up the string section.

1449
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,408
You know what? Only time I get to think
now is when I take a shit at the office.

1450
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,843
I'm starting to associate thoughts
with the smell of shit.

1451
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,761
Well, that is a good line.
I'm gonna use that in a book someday.

1452
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,930
Yeah, I'm sure
and that'll be the best line in the book.

1453
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,330
And by the way, you may never, ever,
use me or anything I say or do..

1454
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,127
..in one of your fucking books again.
That goes for the girls too.

1455
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,005
A, you shouldn't have hooked up
with a writer.

1456
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,646
B, you weren't in the last book
or the one now.

1457
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,451
C, I'm gonna write
about whatever the fuck I want.

1458
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,444
As always, our life works for you.

1459
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,048
No, no, no. Don't give me this
putupon housewife bullshit. Okay?

1460
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,366
This is not the '50s.

1461
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,525
Sorry to ruin your perfect little narrative
of oppression with the truth..

1462
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,929
..but I am the one who's at home
dealing with the bullshit.

1463
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,242
You're at work until 6:30/
Six o'clock.

1464
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,411
You take the girls to school, I pick
them up. That's fair. That's our deal.

1465
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,482
We live in Paris, France, for chrissakes/
And you remind me of it every day.

1466
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,401
I have orbited my entire life around you
and you know it. Okay?

1467
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,649
Sorry if this summer's vacation..
And it is a vacation.

1468
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,487
I've seen you frolic in the sea
and shove salad down your throat.

1469
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,850
But it is not indicative of you
spending your life in domestic servitude.

1470
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,442
You know what I love about men?
They still believe in magic.

1471
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,126
Little fairies around
who pick up their socks..

1472
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,484
..little fairies unload the dishwasher,
little fairies sunscreen the kids.

1473
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,082
Little fairies who make the Greek salad
that you eat like a pig.

1474
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,890
Okay, listen to me. All right?

1475
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,004
You are great at taking care of us.
You are.

1476
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,801
I mean, you take care of the kids,
you take care of your friends..

1477
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,925
..you take care of the world. You
were like that before you were a morn..

1478
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,810
..and now it's only magnified.

1479
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,010
But, and I've been telling you this
for years now..

1480
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,409
..you gotta do a little better job
taking care of yourself.

1481
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,046
Okay, stop patronizing me. All right?

1482
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,006
I'm the one at home every day at 6,
not 6:30. I'm reliable.

1483
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,524
Have you ever booked a babysitter, ever,
in your entire life? No.

1484
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,884
What is the name of their pediatrician?/
Stop quizzing me. It's fucking boring.

1485
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,011
Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at home
every night and I make dinner..

1486
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,283
..give baths and read stories.
Sometimes you're there..

1487
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,565
..sometimes you're at a university event
or a publicity tour. Okay?

1488
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,923
When you get inspired,
you keep on writing.

1489
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,970
I get inspired too sometimes,
you know that?

1490
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,964
You wanna write? Write.
No, but you remember..

1491
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,731
..I used to sing and play guitar
and write songs?

1492
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,328
I'd still like to do it,
but I don't get to. There isn't time.

1493
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,445
Okay. Well, first off,
my writing isn't a hobby. All right?

1494
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,047
Secondly,
I wish you would find the time.

1495
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,369
You somehow find time to complain
about eight hours a day.

1496
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,889
I mean, I love the way you sing. Okay?

1497
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,843
I fucked up my whole life
because of the way you sing. All right?

1498
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,931
If you took oneeighth
of the energy that you spend..

1499
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,600
..on bitching, whining and worrying..

1500
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,488
If you put that energy into playing scales,
you'd be like fucking Django Reinhardt.

1501
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,851
Okay. All right.

1502
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,247
You forgot your shoes.

1503
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,089
Oh, God.

1504
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,765
You think you're winning?

1505
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,846
Few people realize..

1506
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,170
..what it's like for an active
or passionate woman to have a child.

1507
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,369
Friends told me, "You'll wanna
throw them out the window."

1508
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,282
But I never wanted to hurt them once,
but I thought about ending it for myself.

1509
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,482
I was so confused and you were
always away on a stupid book tour..

1510
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,326
..or because of Henry's custody shit,
and I didn't wanna be a burden.

1511
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,086
I know why Sylvia Plath
put her head in a toaster.

1512
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,726
It was an oven/
Don't play with words.

1513
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,810
You know what I mean.
Toaster, oven, same thing.

1514
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,561
You know how many times I was alone
crying with no clue what to do?

1515
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,008
Know the guilt a mother feels
when she doesn't know what to do?

1516
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,369
Do you think you have sole ownership
of that feeling?

1517
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,966
I don't think you understand. Okay?

1518
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,204
You know what my secret fear is?
With every man?

1519
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:57,405
Is that they all wanna turn me
into a submissive housewife.

1520
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,769
Okay. No one could ever do that.
All right?

1521
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,609
I promise. It would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster..

1522
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,525
..than to turn you
into anything submissive.

1523
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,730
I don't think I've recovered
since giving birth.

1524
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,651
When they were born,
I had no idea what to do.

1525
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,731
People expect women
to have this instinct that kicks in..

1526
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,649
..like a female baboon.

1527
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,844
But I had no idea how to do anything.

1528
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,761
I loved them so much
and I was doing everything wrong.

1529
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,568
And you were away so often, calling me,
and asking me how my day went..

1530
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,481
..and I couldn't even say it to you
because I felt so ashamed..

1531
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,806
..to be so clueless.

1532
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,008
I think you did great/
No, I didn't.

1533
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,647
No, you did.
Well, you did a good job faking it, then.

1534
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,529
I just.. I remember the only way
I could get them to sleep..

1535
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:51,281
..was to drag that stupid double stroller
down the stairs..

1536
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,131
..and walk them for hours
in the middle of the night..

1537
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,881
..all the way to Pigalle and back.
I almost got mugged once.

1538
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,483
The only reason why the guy didn't attack
me is that I looked so pathetic.

1539
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,129
The only upside of being over 35
is that you don't get raped as much.

1540
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,809
I read it. It's true.

1541
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,401
Oh, Jesus.

1542
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,527
Once, I remember, I was watching
the twins on a trampoline, you know..

1543
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,643
..and they looked so beautiful..

1544
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,207
..and I was happy
because they were happy.

1545
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,563
You know,
one of them had this HulaHoop..

1546
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,570
..that she was using as a jump rope,
you know..

1547
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,010
..but then the other one wanted it
so they started fighting over it, you know?

1548
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,248
And all of a sudden, I just saw it all.

1549
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:40,729
You know, all this petty jealously
and selfishness, you know?

1550
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:47,485
And I remember thinking,
"Okay, this is the natural human state."

1551
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:53,210
You know, just always a little dissatisfied,
perpetually discontented, you know?

1552
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,244
I mean, look at us.

1553
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,570
Here we are, we are in, you know,
the Garden of Eden..

1554
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,286
..and we can't stop fighting.

1555
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,366
I don't think
there's one natural human state.

1556
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,085
The human state is multiple.

1557
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,568
If that's what you see
when you're watching the girls play..

1558
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,962
..that means you're depressed.

1559
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,207
Okay. Maybe I am.

1560
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:21,530
No, but when I see them fight,
I see beautiful energy of going forward..

1561
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,002
..not letting anyone step on them
or take away what they want.

1562
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,090
I like it when they fight.
It gives me hope for them.

1563
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,442
You see anger as a positive emotion.

1564
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:35,328
You know, you only end up hurting
yourself, your work, the kids, me.

1565
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,805
And you never get angry?

1566
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,970
When I do, I don't see it as a positive.

1567
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,969
You know something?

1568
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,891
The way you write,
people come up to me and think..

1569
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,051
..I make love
to some wildcat Henry Miller type.

1570
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:01,288
You like to have sex
the exact same way every time.

1571
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,050
When you got it, you got it.

1572
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:07,040
Kissy, kissy. Tittie, tittie. Pussy.

1573
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,846
I'm a man of simple pleasures.

1574
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,646
Yeah, very simple..

1575
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,411
..and I've been meaning
to tell you that lately.

1576
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,650
You're no Henry Miller, on any level.

1577
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,330
And you know what?
This room gives me the creeps.

1578
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,729
I was expecting something quaint,
like the real Greece.

1579
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,042
Place is real/
What are we doing here?

1580
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,881
This is too planned, like we're supposed
to have this great evening.

1581
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,084
No room for spontaneity.
It is all gone from our lives.

1582
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,090
This is stupid and it's not working/
Obviously.

1583
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,648
And I curse Ariadni
and that perv Stefanos for doing this.

1584
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,330
Okay. A couple's massage?

1585
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,040
What the fuck is that?
That sounds sleazy to me.

1586
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,971
We don't have to do it! Okay?

1587
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,401
Come on, this place isn't so bad.

1588
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,329
I like hotel rooms.

1589
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,124
I think they're sexy.

1590
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,442
Yeah, I know you do..

1591
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,682
..Mr. BookTour.

1592
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,011
Mr. RadissonHilton.

1593
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:12,205
And I know that time when you
were doing that reading in Washington..

1594
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,883
..when your cell phone supposedly broke
that night. How convenient.

1595
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,526
Swear on our kids you didn't fuck
that lady from the bookstore. Emily.

1596
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,970
Swear to me
you didn't fuck that Emily girl.

1597
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,527
And I'm not jealous
because I'm not the type.

1598
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,883
But I just wanna know. Okay?
Be a man and admit the truth.

1599
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,883
I am giving you my whole life, okay?

1600
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,651
I got nothing larger to give.

1601
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,763
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

1602
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,648
If you're looking for permission
to disqualify me..

1603
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,683
..I'm not gonna give it to you.

1604
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,327
Okay? I love you..

1605
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,601
..and I am not in conflict about it.
Okay?

1606
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,002
But if what you want is a laundry list..

1607
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,522
..of things about you that piss me off,
I could give it to you.

1608
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,161
Yeah. I want to hear/
Okay. Well..

1609
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,848
..let's start at number one, okay?
Number one, you're fucking nuts.

1610
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,611
All right? You are.
Good luck finding somebody..

1611
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,247
..to put up with your shit
for more than, like, six months. Okay?

1612
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:19,849
But I accept the whole package,
the crazy and the brilliant, all right?

1613
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,250
You're not gonna change, I don't want
you to. It's accepting you for being you.

1614
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,480
I asked a question. If, while I was carrying
that double stroller down the stairs..

1615
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,765
..and getting assraped in Pigalle,
you fucked that little Emily Bronté girl?

1616
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,731
I don't know what Emily.
What are you talking about?

1617
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,486
The one that wrote the emails
about Dostoevsky?

1618
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,842
"Oh, Jesse, you're so right.

1619
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,364
The Grand Commander is the deepest
passage of all of Russian literature."

1620
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,369
If you're asking me..

1621
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,730
..if I'm committed to you, the girls
and the life we built together..

1622
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,447
..the answer is a resounding yes.

1623
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,883
So you did fuck her.
Thank you very much.

1624
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,961
Do I ask about the time you went to your
old boyfriend after his mother died? No.

1625
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,647
Why? Because I know the way
that your fucking French ass works..

1626
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:13,164
..and I guarantee that you at least blew
that guy, but I also know you love me.

1627
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,648
All right? I'm okay with you
being a complicated human being.

1628
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,805
I don't wanna live a boring life
where two people own each other..

1629
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,891
..where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created..

1630
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:29,085
..because that is a bunch
of stifling bullshit!

1631
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,966
Oh, God. Well..

1632
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,722
You know what's going on here?
It's simple.

1633
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,402
I don't think I love you anymore.

1634
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,561
Miss?/
I don't wanna talk right now.

1635
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,922
Here by yourself
or waiting for somebody?

1636
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,730
I'm by myself and happy to be.

1637
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,481
I'm an angry person and I hurt my kids,
my work and everyone I love.

1638
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,808
Just my type..

1639
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,844
Okay. I'm not in the mood.
I came here to be alone.

1640
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:28,204
I've just been checking you out, and I
don't wanna make you uncomfortable..

1641
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,768
..but you are, by far,
the bestlooking woman in this place.

1642
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,327
Thank you/
I'd love to buy you a drink..

1643
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,000
..maybe talk to you,
get to know you a bit.

1644
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,611
Are you here on business?

1645
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,804
Okay. I see. You have a boyfriend?

1646
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,240
Not anymore.

1647
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,649
Jeez, sorry to hear that.
God, you wanna talk about it?

1648
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,605
I don't talk to strangers.

1649
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,651
That's the thing, I'm not a stranger.
No, no, no, we've met before.

1650
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,682
Summer '94.

1651
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,086
You're mistaking me
for someone else/ No.

1652
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,729
We even fell in love/
Really?

1653
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,848
I vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic..

1654
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,250
..who made me feel like I wasn't alone.
Someone who had respect for who I was.

1655
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,210
That's me. I'm that guy.

1656
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,650
I don't think so.

1657
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,003
See, I know something about tonight
that you don't know.

1658
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,000
Really? What is that?

1659
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,801
Something important.

1660
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:33,206
You see, I know because I've actually
already lived through this night.

1661
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,846
How?/
I'm a time traveler.

1662
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,726
Okay.

1663
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:43,642
No, I have a time machine in my room.
I've come to save you, like I said I would.

1664
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,686
Save me from what?/
From being blinded by the bullshit of life.

1665
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,126
It's not bullshit.

1666
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,085
I assure you,
that guy you vaguely remember..

1667
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,204
..the sweet romantic one
that you met on a train?

1668
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,601
That is me.

1669
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,123
That's you?/
Yeah.

1670
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,766
Guess I didn't recognize you.

1671
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,205
You look like shit.

1672
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,122
What can I say? I mean,
it's tough out there in time and space.

1673
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,244
You, on the other hand..

1674
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,330
..are even more beautiful
than I remember.

1675
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,446
Bullshit.

1676
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,608
Jesse, this is not a game.

1677
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,288
You get all cute, you get in my panties.
And next thing I know, I'm in Chicago.

1678
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,807
Not gonna make it better
by some pickup line.

1679
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,924
I'm not trying to pick you up.
No, you misunderstand me.

1680
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,930
No, no, no.
I'm only here as a messenger.

1681
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,408
I've just traveled all the way
from the future.

1682
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,850
I was just with your 82yearold self..

1683
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,567
..who gave me a letter to read to you.

1684
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,125
So here I am.

1685
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,483
I'm still alive in my 80's?

1686
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,762
Oh, yeah.

1687
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,881
How's my French ass?/
Nice.

1688
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,048
Okay/
Really nice.

1689
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,921
I don't care about the way I look/
There's more of you to love.

1690
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,162
Great/
You want me to read it to you?

1691
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,204
Do I have a choice?/
Sure. If you're not interested..

1692
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,646
No, no, no.

1693
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,162
Read it/
Okay. All right. Well, here it is.

1694
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:16,446
"Dear Celine, I am writing to you
from the other side of the woods.

1695
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,122
This letter is lighting
a candle that will.."/ Okay, stop it.

1696
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,847
I would never write this.
"Other side of the woods." What woods?

1697
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,202
May I please continue?/
Okay.

1698
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,324
"I am sending you this young man.

1699
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,971
Yes, young.

1700
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,369
And he will be your escort.

1701
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,724
God knows he has many problems
and has struggled his whole life..

1702
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:44,290
..connecting and being present
even with those he loves the most.

1703
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,484
And for that he is deeply sorry.

1704
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,443
But you are his only hope.

1705
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,965
Celine, my advice to you is this.

1706
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,126
You're entering the best years
of your life.

1707
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:02,210
Looking back from where I sit now..

1708
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:06,403
..these middle years
are only a little bit more difficult..

1709
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,324
..than when you were 12..

1710
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,451
..and Mathieu and Vanessa
danced all night..

1711
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,211
..to the Bee Gees
"How Deep ls Your Love."'

1712
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,568
I don't know about that. Anyway..

1713
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,922
"Celine, you will be fine.

1714
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:24,205
Your girls will grow up to become
examples and icons of feminism."

1715
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,249
Nice one/
Yeah.

1716
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:30,126
I just noticed there's a postscript
at the bottom. Looks important.

1717
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,322
Maybe I should skip over some of this.

1718
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,284
Yeah, skip away. Please/
Okay.

1719
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,164
You sure? Yeah, okay/
Yeah.

1720
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,964
All right/
Boring stuff.

1721
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,802
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's like, blah,
blah, blah, financial tips..

1722
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,446
..horoscope stuff. Okay, here it is.

1723
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:49,844
"P.S. By the way, the best..

1724
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:56,366
By the way, the best sex of my life
happened one night..

1725
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,325
..in the southern Peloponnese.

1726
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,443
Don't miss it.

1727
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:07,249
My whole sexual being went
to a new, groundbreaking level."

1728
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,364
Groundbreaking. Great/
I don't know what that means.

1729
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,291
Okay, Jesse,
can you stop this stupid game?

1730
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,327
We're not in one of your stories. Okay?

1731
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,924
Did you hear what I said to you
back in the room? Did you hear me?

1732
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,609
Yes, I heard you.

1733
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,926
What, that you don't love me anymore?

1734
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,928
I figured you didn't mean it,
but if you did, then..

1735
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:38,169
Oh, fuck it. Know something? You're just
like the little girls and everybody else.

1736
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,402
You wanna live inside some fairy tale.

1737
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,762
I'm just trying to make things better.

1738
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,725
I tell you I love you,
I tell you you're beautiful..

1739
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,963
..I tell you that your ass looks great
when you're 80.

1740
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,769
I'm trying to make you laugh/
Okay.

1741
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,209
All right,
I put up with plenty of your shit.

1742
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,770
And if you think I'm just some dog who's
gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.

1743
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,851
But if you want true love, then this is it.

1744
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,884
This is real life.
It's not perfect, but it's real.

1745
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:13,210
And if you can't see it, then you're blind,
all right, and I give up.

1746
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,047
Oh, God.

1747
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,806
So, what about this time machine?

1748
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,883
What do you mean?

1749
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,088
How does it work?

1750
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,007
Well, it's complicated.

1751
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:11,963
Am I gonna have to get naked
to operate it?

1752
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,811
I mean..

1753
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,647
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually..
It's been a real issue, you know?

1754
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:24,408
I mean, I.. Clothes, they don't travel well
through the whole spacetime continuum.

1755
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,125
It's..

1756
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,128
You're so smart/
Oh, jeez.

1757
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,529
Spacetime..?/
Continuum.

1758
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,841
Continuum/
Yeah. Really.

1759
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,961
There's something that I've
been thinking about, about your letter.

1760
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:46,242
Yeah?/
You know, you..

1761
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,205
You mentioned the southern
Peloponnese?

1762
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:53,724
Yeah, yeah,
and we're in the southern Peloponnese.

1763
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,571
Yeah,
and do you think it could be tonight..

1764
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,969
..that you're still talking about
in your 80's?

1765
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,810
Well..

1766
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,647
..it must have been one hell of a night
we're about to have.
