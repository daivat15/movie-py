1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,208
Subtiles loaded...

2
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,996
May the All Mother...

3
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:07,206
...smile upon our first meeting.

4
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,416
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

5
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,886
I studied for five years...

6
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,966
...but there is much to learn.

7
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,426
Calm people, calm.

8
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:47,016
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

9
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:52,396
These demons are forbidden here.

10
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,526
There has been a sign.

11
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:57,866
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

12
00:49:02,696 --> 00:49:03,696
Bring him.

13
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,246
Father...

14
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:30,876
...I see you.

15
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:44,006
This creature...

16
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:47,386
...why do you bring him here?

17
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,226
I was going to kill him...

18
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:52,346
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

19
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,606
I have said...

20
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:57,276
...no dreamwalker will come here.

21
00:50:58,696 --> 00:51:01,526
His alien smell fills my nose.

22
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:14,706
Step back!

23
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:20,256
I will look at this alien.

24
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:20,636
A warrior! I could kill him easily!

25
00:52:20,856 --> 00:52:22,146
No!

26
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:26,776
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

27
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,736
...we have seen.

28
00:52:28,736 --> 00:52:31,616
We need to learn more about him.

29
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:35,996
My Daughter...

30
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:40,376
...you will teach him our way...

31
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:43,836
...to speak and walk as we do.

32
00:52:43,836 --> 00:52:47,466
Why me? That's not fair...

33
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:54,746
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

34
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:00,286
Neytiri.

35
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:01,996
Neytili.

36
00:54:02,496 --> 00:54:04,296
Neytiri.

37
00:54:04,756 --> 00:54:06,666
Neytiri.

38
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:27,216
This alien will learn nothing...

39
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:29,256
...a rock sees more...

40
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:31,516
...look at him.

41
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:28,156
I see you...

42
01:15:28,246 --> 01:15:29,456
...Brother

43
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:32,116
...and thank you.

44
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:38,126
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

45
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,506
Your body stays behind...

46
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:43,466
...to become part of The People.

47
01:20:53,906 --> 01:20:55,776
That moron's going to die.

48
01:21:19,636 --> 01:21:21,596
Don't be afraid, warrior.

49
01:33:25,276 --> 01:33:29,576
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

50
01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:34,036
You are part of The People.

51
01:41:20,796 --> 01:41:22,966
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

52
01:41:29,556 --> 01:41:30,846
Stop please!

53
01:41:32,346 --> 01:41:34,476
This will only make it worse.

54
01:41:37,436 --> 01:41:39,226
We will strike them in the heart.

55
01:42:56,726 --> 01:42:58,596
I have something to say...

56
01:43:00,936 --> 01:43:02,396
...to all of you.

57
01:43:37,886 --> 01:43:39,306
You see?

58
01:43:39,476 --> 01:43:41,936
It is a demon in a false body.

59
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:06,486
Father!

60
01:50:06,656 --> 01:50:07,696
Mother!

61
01:50:07,696 --> 01:50:10,946
Eytukan, I have something to say.

62
01:50:11,036 --> 01:50:12,446
Listen!

63
01:50:13,496 --> 01:50:14,956
Speak, Jakesully.

64
01:50:16,326 --> 01:50:19,286
A great evil is upon us...

65
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:21,496
The Sky People are coming...

66
01:50:21,746 --> 01:50:24,256
...to destroy Hometree.

67
01:51:39,576 --> 01:51:40,746
Bind them.

68
01:52:23,416 --> 01:52:25,456
- Run to the forest! - They're coming!

69
01:52:40,686 --> 01:52:44,346
Have no fear.

70
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:06,706
Take the ikran...

71
01:53:06,706 --> 01:53:08,296
...attack from above.

72
01:54:42,466 --> 01:54:44,216
Get everyone to the forest.

73
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:31,886
Father!

74
01:59:47,736 --> 01:59:49,066
Daughter...

75
01:59:50,236 --> 01:59:53,316
take... my... bow.

76
01:59:57,446 --> 02:00:01,916
Protect The People.

77
02:11:46,116 --> 02:11:48,456
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

78
02:11:49,076 --> 02:11:51,126
...I stand before you...

79
02:11:52,126 --> 02:11:55,296
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

80
02:12:12,516 --> 02:12:13,936
Toruk Macto,

81
02:13:51,246 --> 02:13:53,866
Hear us please, All Mother.

82
02:13:54,416 --> 02:13:56,746
Eywa, help her.

83
02:13:57,416 --> 02:13:59,626
Take this spirit into you...

84
02:14:03,166 --> 02:14:05,426
...and breathe her back to us.

85
02:14:09,216 --> 02:14:10,886
Let her walk among us...

86
02:14:13,386 --> 02:14:15,346
...as one of The People.

87
02:47:10,446 --> 02:47:11,656
Are The People safe?

88
02:47:14,496 --> 02:47:15,616
They're safe.
