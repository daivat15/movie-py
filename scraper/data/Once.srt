1
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:41,342
Well, the healing has begun

2
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:52,186
I want you to put on
your pretty summer dress, yeah

3
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:53,813
You can wear
your Easter clothes

4
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:58,567
Sunday bonnet
and all the rest

5
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:04,031
But I want to make love
to you, yes, yes, yes, yes

6
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:07,118
Well, the healing
has begun...

7
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,998
Well, the healing
has begun.

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,335
Fuckin' deadly
you are, mate.

9
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:23,176
Don't fuckin...

10
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:27,221
I'm just tying me lace, man,
you know what I mean?

11
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,353
I swear to you, you
fucking go near that,

12
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:36,981
I'm after
you right straight away.

13
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,816
- So fuck off, right?
- Hell, I'm just tying my fuckin' lace and everything.

14
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,902
Fuck's sake.

15
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,195
Look here. Here.

16
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,155
Play us "Aslan," will ya?

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,075
All right, mate,
you're fuckin' rapid, you are.

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,201
Thanks.

19
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,041
Oh, yeah, la-la

20
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:02,047
Hmm-mm...

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,010
- Hold that will you?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,136
Thanks.

23
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,576
Anton, fucking hell, man.

24
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,911
Come on, give me that.

25
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,746
Give me the case.

26
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,374
What are you fucking at, man?

27
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,418
For fuck's sake.

28
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,294
- I'm...
- What are you at, man?

29
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:42,630
I'm sorry, man,

30
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,841
I'm just fucking dying sick,
man, you know what I mean?

31
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,802
Here, I'll go
on and help you.

32
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:50,804
- Oh, fuck.
- There's all your money.

33
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,806
I'm just dying
sick and all.

34
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,559
Look, there's 20 cent.
Look it.

35
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,062
Look, don't fucking rob me.

36
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,482
I'm down there trying to fucking
make a living like anyone else.

37
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,984
The two of us is on
the same team, man.

38
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm sorry, right,
I'm sorry, man.

39
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,446
But you're right.
You're rapid, you are.

40
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,198
You want money, just fucking,
just ask me for it.

41
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,658
Don't have me chase you all
the way up the street for it.

42
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:16,038
Want to give us that
fiver then, do ya?

43
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:20,291
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here.

44
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:21,877
How's your ma?

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,962
She's dead, man.

46
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,214
Well, how's your old fella?

47
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:27,799
Fair play to ya, right?

48
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:30,010
I'll see you later,
all right.

49
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:31,804
Look, there's two euros, look.

50
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,222
Fair play to ya, right?

51
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,973
See you, good luck, man.

52
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,086
Scratching
at the surface now

53
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:10,884
And I'm trying hard
to work it out

54
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:18,141
And so much has gone
misunderstood

55
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:25,190
And this mystery
only leads to doubt

56
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:31,446
And I didn't understand

57
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:38,411
When you reached out
to take my hand

58
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:45,376
And if you have
something to say

59
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,758
You'd better say it now

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,678
'Cause this is
what you've waited for

61
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:02,268
Your chance to even up
the score

62
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,733
And as these shadows fall

63
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:14,530
On me now I'll win somehow

64
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,033
Yeah

65
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:24,082
'Cause I'm picking up
a message, Lord

66
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:30,672
That I'm closer
than I've ever been before

67
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:34,926
So if you have something
to say

68
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,720
Say it to me now

69
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,269
Just say it to me now, now

70
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:52,651
Oh, oh

71
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:55,738
Oh

72
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,699
Oh.

73
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:14,173
Thanks.

74
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,968
Ten cents,
brilliant. Thanks.

75
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,803
Excuse me?

76
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,972
Sorry.

77
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,017
Big Issue?

78
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,394
Can't afford it.

79
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,981
This song you just play,
you write it?

80
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,649
Working on it.

81
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,526
It's not an established song?

82
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,904
No, it's not an
established song.

83
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:37,238
How come you don't play it

84
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:38,364
during daytime?

85
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,866
I see you every day.

86
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,869
You know, during the day, people
want to hear songs they know,

87
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,412
just songs that they recognize.

88
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:45,998
I mean, otherwise,
I wouldn't make any money.

89
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,832
I play these songs at night.
They wouldn't listen.

90
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,876
I listen.

91
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,670
Yeah, but you gave me ten cents.

92
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:54,964
You do it
for money then?

93
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,382
Why don't you
get a job

94
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,593
in a shop?

95
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:00,678
I have a job in a shop.

96
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:02,889
Listen, I'm going to get
back to this, yeah?

97
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,099
Nice to meet you.

98
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:06,434
Who'd you write that song
for, please?

99
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,936
No one.

100
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:15,359
Bullshit.

101
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,903
Where is she?

102
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,365
She's gone.

103
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,283
She's dead?

104
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,745
No, she's not dead, she's gone.

105
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,538
You love her still?

106
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,708
Jesus, man.

107
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:36,047
You're over her.

108
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,298
Rubbish.

109
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,425
No one who would write
this song is over her.

110
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,136
I'm telling you.

111
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:44,055
You play this marvelous song
to her, you get her back.

112
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,098
I don't want her back.

113
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:48,977
I see.

114
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,938
What shop you work in?

115
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,899
I work in a Hoover repair shop.

116
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,233
A Hoover?

117
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,902
You know, like a vacuum cleaner.
Whhzzz.

118
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,113
You fix vacuum cleaners?

119
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,239
I do.

120
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:04,283
I have a broken vacuum cleaner.

121
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,077
- You fix it for me?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,829
I bring it tomorrow then?

123
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:08,788
Okay.

124
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,789
This is great.

125
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:10,791
Tomorrow?

126
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:11,833
Right.

127
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,793
- Okay, bye.
- Good luck.

128
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:24,554
You have broken me
all the way down

129
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:29,016
Down upon my knees

130
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:38,818
And you have broken me
all the way now

131
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,952
Hi. This is Catherine.

132
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,579
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

133
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:14,062
I'll be far to sea

134
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,611
That job's ready
for collection now, Dad.

135
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,322
Okay, son.

136
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:25,782
I'm going to head into town.

137
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,079
Should I turn this
around for you?

138
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,248
What'll I get for dinner?

139
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:35,874
The fish, maybe.

140
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:02,944
Hello.

141
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,070
How are you? How's it going?

142
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:06,572
I bring you my Hoover.

143
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,870
All right.

144
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,872
What's wrong with it?

145
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,916
It is fucked.

146
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,792
It doesn't suck up
the dirt.

147
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,378
Well, listen, there's
nothing I can do,

148
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,254
I don't have any of my
tools or nothing with me.

149
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:23,797
I'm going on me break now.

150
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:25,550
Can you bring it in
tomorrow or something?

151
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,635
Well, no, I bring it today.

152
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:31,221
- You, you...
- Yeah, but there's nothing I can do with it, love,

153
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,390
I don't have
me tools, or...

154
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:34,225
It's like I have
to bring it home.

155
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:37,144
If I come on break, you have
a look at it at least?

156
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,564
Yeah, but you
don't understand.

157
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,149
I come with you, then?

158
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,694
For lunch?

159
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,736
Yeah, all right.

160
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,238
- Yes, we go together?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,989
Okay.

162
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:51,075
Thank you.

163
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,119
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

164
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:06,590
So you know a bit
about music then?

165
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:11,720
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

166
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,389
He played violin.

167
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,186
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

168
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,646
Really?

169
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:24,441
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

170
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,818
"It's not so hard
on the fingers," he said.

171
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,947
Do you get to play much?

172
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,158
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

173
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,286
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

174
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,578
I can't afford it.

175
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,915
Yeah, it's expensive
all right.

176
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,052
I play in a
piano shop.

177
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,511
This man lets me play...

178
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,847
one hour per day
at lunch.

179
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,515
Somewhere around here?

180
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,893
You want to
hear me play?

181
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:00,894
- Yeah.
- Now?

182
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:01,937
Yeah.

183
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,231
Okay.

184
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,568
Can we come in?

185
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,163
This is the man
I was telling you about.

186
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,332
He's a real gentleman.

187
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,375
Hi.

188
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,626
Okay for me
to play today?

189
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,835
Yeah, that's fine.

190
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,003
Thanks.

191
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,506
Not the baby Yamaha
though. She's sold.

192
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,632
- Okie-dokie.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,223
Now, which one today?

194
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,508
That kind of thing.

195
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,179
It's amazing.

196
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,264
Did you write that?

197
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,183
No, no, Mendelssohn did.

198
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,309
It's good.

199
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,437
It's good, yes.

200
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,647
Play me another
of your songs.

201
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,648
No.

202
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,649
Please.

203
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,692
Not here.

204
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,443
Why? Here, Billy
doesn't mind.

205
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:16,196
- You think it would be all right?
- Yes.

206
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,533
Okay.

207
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,117
Let's put that there, yeah?

208
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,202
Mm-hmm.

209
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,373
This is in C, yeah?

210
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,458
Yeah, okay,
I can see that.

211
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,877
Okay.

212
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:32,796
So, it goes, um...

213
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,133
Da... It goes,
Da-da-da-da

214
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:44,599
Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da

215
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,351
Yeah? And then there's
a bit in there...

216
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:47,770
Can you do that?

217
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:56,153
Da-da-da-da-da...

218
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:57,362
Brilliant.

219
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,155
And then there's another
part that goes, uh...

220
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,701
Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa

221
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:06,788
Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa

222
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,667
Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa

223
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,836
Yeah? And then the
chorus, let's see.

224
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,129
- You have those two bits?
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,338
And the chorus goes...

226
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,508
Da-da-da-da-da

227
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:26,516
Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa

228
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:33,398
Ba-ba... da-da.

229
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,941
That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.

230
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,819
So, do you want
to give it a spin?

231
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,363
- Yes, try it.
- Okay.

232
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,198
Two, three,

233
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,408
four.

234
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:05,096
I don't know you,
but I want you

235
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:12,645
All the more for that

236
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:20,112
And words fall through me
and always fool me

237
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:25,616
And I can't react

238
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,786
We change here.

239
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:36,127
And games that never amount
to more than they're meant

240
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:41,341
Will play themselves out

241
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:42,675
Hold it.

242
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,219
And the chorus.

243
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:54,353
Take this sinking boat
and point it home

244
00:16:54,438 --> 00:17:00,485
We've still got time

245
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:05,281
Raise your hopeful voice

246
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,576
You had the choice

247
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:16,126
You've made it now

248
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:26,636
Falling slowly,
eyes that know me

249
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,848
And I can't go back

250
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:41,651
Moods that take me
and erase me

251
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:49,033
And I'm painted black

252
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:57,666
Well, you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself

253
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:02,213
It's time that you won

254
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:06,009
Again.

255
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:15,935
Take this sinking boat
and point it home

256
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:22,317
We've still got time

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,071
Raise your hopeful voice

258
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:30,324
You had the choice

259
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:37,707
You've made it now

260
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:48,758
Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh...

261
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,140
Yeah

262
00:18:54,223 --> 00:19:02,356
Take this sinking boat
and point it home

263
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,779
We've still got time

264
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:13,284
Raise your hopeful voice

265
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:23,085
You had the choice,
you've made it now

266
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:31,093
Falling slowly,
sing your melody

267
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:38,100
I'll sing along...

268
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:56,702
Ah, ah...

269
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,209
Call and I'll sing along.

270
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,034
I moved back in
about a year ago,

271
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:39,203
after me ma died, just to
help me dad out, you know.

272
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:43,874
So tell me about her.

273
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,876
Who, me ma?

274
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:50,880
No, the girl, the special girl
you write these songs for.

275
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,174
No.

276
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:54,509
Come on.

277
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:56,262
What did she do to you?

278
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,185
Well.

279
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:11,485
Ten years ago, I fell in
love with an Irish girl

280
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:14,488
She took my heart

281
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:20,160
But she went and screwed
some guy that she knew

282
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:25,165
And now I'm in Dublin
with a broken heart

283
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:30,504
Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker guy

284
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,842
Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker...

285
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,511
Sucker guy

286
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:42,766
One day, I'll go there
and win her once again

287
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:49,273
But until then, I'm just
a sucker of a guy.

288
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,116
So she's with him now?

289
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,200
- No.
- Don't know.

290
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,244
Where is she?

291
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:07,207
She's in old London town

292
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:14,172
Living somewhere
around Chiswick.

293
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:21,054
I miss her.
It's just sort of... you know.

294
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,433
You're not going
to go get her?

295
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:27,311
No?

296
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:30,605
No. Fuck her.

297
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,608
Fuck her,
fuck her.

298
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,109
Fuck her, she's gone

299
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:37,112
Fuck her, she's gone forever

300
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:38,823
She fucking fucked it up...!

301
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:41,533
Sorry.

302
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,702
Fucking fucked it up

303
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:47,789
She fucking fucked it up!

304
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,999
And now she's gonna die.

305
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,720
Give us the sharp eight
there, son.

306
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:10,312
And the Phillips.

307
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,355
Come on.

308
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,069
Your son
is a very talented man, sir.

309
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:19,863
Well, he should be.
I trained him meself.

310
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:21,657
Oh, no. I meant the songs.

311
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,825
Oh, right. Is he?

312
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,660
- Very.
- Okay, that's done.

313
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,663
You can take it back
with you.

314
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,831
It was just the belt,
so it should be all right now.

315
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,833
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

316
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,377
Oh, you're fine there;
it's free.

317
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,504
Nothing's for free.
How much?

318
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,466
Say four euro, love.

319
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:44,971
Okay. We're going
to head upstairs, Dad.

320
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:47,182
Is there anything
else you need?

321
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,558
No, I'm grand.

322
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:49,934
Okay.

323
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:51,895
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

324
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:53,647
And you.

325
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,898
Take care.

326
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,566
Good.

327
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,701
Come on in.

328
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,501
There you are.

329
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,231
Wow.

330
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:39,859
Can you transfer this stuff onto
disc for me so I can listen?

331
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,903
Yeah.

332
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:43,238
I have to go now.

333
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:46,407
Do you want to stay?

334
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,577
What do you mean?

335
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,828
Stay the night?

336
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,206
What?

337
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,253
Fuck this.

338
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,963
Thanks for the Hoover, yeah?

339
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:01,548
- See you.
- See you around.

340
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:07,595
Fuck.

341
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:13,560
Flowers? Flowers?

342
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:21,526
- Hey.
- Hey.

343
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,612
How's it going?

344
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:25,405
Hey, where you going?

345
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:28,324
I wanted to give you the CDs
that I made for you.

346
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm really...
I'm just really lonely,

347
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:33,788
and you're gorgeous,
and I just...

348
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:35,832
I'm sorry. I fucked up.
I'm sorry. I...

349
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:38,626
I don't know what to say.

350
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,211
It won't happen again.

351
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:48,678
Do you have a CD player?

352
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,346
Yeah.

353
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,974
Here you go.

354
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:56,144
Batteries are pretty low,
but it should work.

355
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:58,187
I give it back.

356
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,856
No problem. Keep it.

357
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,484
I have to go now.

358
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,193
I'll talk
to you later.

359
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:06,488
You don't want to get a cup of
tea or something? I'd love to...

360
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:08,198
just talk to you
a bit more.

361
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:10,700
I have responsibilities.
I have to go home.

362
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:13,245
Is it okay to walk along
with you then?

363
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,662
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:17,206
Cool. Cool.
So how was it today?

365
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:19,334
Selling good.

366
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,210
And today is a really good day
for me

367
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:25,089
because I got a job
in a big house, cleaning.

368
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:28,759
This lady is going to pay me
some money, so I'm very happy.

369
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:30,929
That's brilliant.
I'm delighted.

370
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:42,566
This is where I live.

371
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:45,943
Oh, yeah? Cool.

372
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:47,862
All right, then.

373
00:26:47,946 --> 00:26:49,572
Do you want to come in?

374
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:53,868
Can I? Yeah. Cool.

375
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,495
Hi, guys.

376
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:56,621
Hello.

377
00:26:56,704 --> 00:26:57,622
How are you today?

378
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:58,789
Not bad, not bad.

379
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,167
How is work?

380
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,793
It's great.

381
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,961
See you later.

382
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,210
Ah, hi.

383
00:27:46,546 --> 00:27:48,464
This is my friend.
This is my mother.

384
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,592
How are you?

385
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:52,677
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

386
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:00,142
This is my
daughter Ivonka.

387
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:02,937
Come on.

388
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:05,231
Hello, Ivonka. Hello.

389
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:19,495
Sorry?

390
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:22,081
That's dinner. Do you
want to stay for dinner?

391
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:23,666
Yeah. Thank you.

392
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,388
Want to sit down?

393
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:38,640
Yeah.

394
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,999
Well, what did she say?

395
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:06,667
She says you're handsome.

396
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,001
She what?

397
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:09,671
Says you're handsome.

398
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:11,213
How do I say thanks?

399
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:17,428
Says, "You're welcome. "

400
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:19,179
Cool. Thanks.

401
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:20,557
Try to speak a little English, Mama.

402
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,225
No, thank you.

403
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:25,686
Careful.

404
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,146
Careful, Ivonka.
Don't do that.

405
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,731
She's grand.
She's grand.

406
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,651
Where's her dad?

407
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:35,196
He doesn't live here.

408
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,865
Why not?

409
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,577
He's at home.

410
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,460
Hello. Hi.

411
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,963
These are
from next door.

412
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:54,298
They come in
to watch telly.

413
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:56,175
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys.

414
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,719
There's only one
telly in the building.

415
00:29:57,802 --> 00:29:59,428
We watch Fair City together.

416
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:01,138
Fair City, we love.

417
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,974
We learn English
from Fair City.

418
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:05,810
Are you not pregnant?

419
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,980
How are you, man?

420
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:12,066
What is the hurry?

421
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,829
Just put her in there.

422
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:27,205
Okay.

423
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,501
There you go, dearie.

424
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,756
Okay.

425
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,466
She likes you.

426
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:14,211
You have no lyrics
for this one?

427
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:16,671
It's really good.
I like it.

428
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:21,176
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

429
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:24,138
Huh?

430
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:29,267
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

431
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:31,812
What? Do you like it?

432
00:31:31,895 --> 00:31:33,146
It's great.

433
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,108
Would you be into trying...
trying to write lyrics for it?

434
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:38,860
Really? I could?

435
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,362
Yeah. Do you
like that idea?

436
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:42,156
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

437
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,365
That would be good.

438
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,158
I can keep machine
and write it?

439
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,494
Yeah. Do. I was having
a bit of trouble with it.

440
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:49,538
It's too romantic for me.

441
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:51,164
It is romantic.

442
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:53,083
You have a
romantic streak.

443
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:56,211
I used to have
a romantic streak.

444
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:58,004
When?

445
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:02,092
When I was your age,
I suppose.

446
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:04,094
I see. You're
an old man now.

447
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,679
Yeah. Dying.

448
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,683
Cynical.

449
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:15,731
You have to go now.

450
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:18,441
Thanks for the Hoover
and food and songs.

451
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,027
No problem.

452
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,491
Thanks for the company.

453
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:28,160
I needed it.

454
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:29,536
Me, too.

455
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:34,207
You don't want
to go for late coffee

456
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:35,875
or a walk or something? No?

457
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:37,628
I can't. See you.

458
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:39,212
Bye.

459
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,964
See you.

460
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:18,919
Fuck you, batteries.

461
00:33:36,103 --> 00:33:38,230
Jesus.

462
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,448
I'll pay you back.

463
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,869
Come on.

464
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,467
Are you really here

465
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,472
Or am I dreaming?

466
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:18,061
I can't tell dream
from truth

467
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:21,147
For it's been so long

468
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,984
Since I have seen you

469
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:30,990
I can hardly remember
your face anymore

470
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:37,664
When I get pretty lonely

471
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:43,503
And the distance
causes only silence

472
00:34:43,587 --> 00:34:50,135
I think of you smiling

473
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,847
With pride in your eyes

474
00:34:53,888 --> 00:34:57,350
Lover that sighs

475
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:03,230
If you want me

476
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:09,738
Satisfy me

477
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,994
If you want me

478
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:22,542
Satisfy me

479
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:31,759
Are you really sure
that you believe me

480
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:37,432
When others say I lie?

481
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:44,439
I wonder if you could
ever despise me

482
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:50,153
When you know I really tried

483
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:53,573
To be a better one

484
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:57,118
To satisfy you

485
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,915
For you're everything to me

486
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:09,673
And I'll do what you ask me

487
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:16,638
If you let me be free

488
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:22,643
If you want me

489
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:29,150
Satisfy me

490
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:35,490
If you want me

491
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:42,288
Satisfy me

492
00:36:54,676 --> 00:37:00,890
If you want me

493
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:07,146
Satisfy me

494
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:13,611
If you want me

495
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:19,783
Satisfy me

496
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:05,871
Escalated

497
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:12,420
Little cracks they escalated

498
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:20,011
From back inside comes

499
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:24,223
Lies, lies

500
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:28,519
Breaking...

501
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:30,730
When will...

502
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:33,566
When will you learn?

503
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:44,952
I think it's time
we give it up

504
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:51,584
And figure out
what's stopping us

505
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:58,382
From breathing easy

506
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:05,681
And talking straight

507
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:12,397
The way is clear
if you're ready now

508
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:20,112
The volunteer
is slowing down

509
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:24,992
And taking time

510
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:34,001
To save himself

511
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:41,175
The little cracks,
they escalated

512
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:47,346
Before we knew
it was too late

513
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:54,813
For making circles

514
00:39:54,856 --> 00:40:01,154
And telling lies

515
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,826
You're moving
too fast for me

516
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:13,707
And I, I can't
keep up with you

517
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:20,548
Maybe if you
slowed down for me

518
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:25,844
I could see
you're only telling

519
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:31,767
Lies, lies, lies

520
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:37,522
Breaking us down with your

521
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:43,236
Lies, lies, lies

522
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:49,076
When will you learn?

523
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:19,481
The little cracks,
they escalated

524
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:25,947
Before we knew
it was too late

525
00:41:25,988 --> 00:41:32,912
For making circles

526
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:40,586
And telling lies

527
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:45,423
You're moving
too fast for me

528
00:41:45,508 --> 00:41:51,179
And I, I can't keep up with you

529
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:57,352
Maybe if you'd
slow down for me

530
00:41:57,436 --> 00:42:03,108
I could see
you're only telling

531
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,363
Lies, lies, lies

532
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:14,160
Breaking us down with your

533
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:20,291
Lies, lies, lies

534
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:26,966
When will you learn?

535
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:32,596
So plant the thought

536
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,773
Would you like to buy a flower?

537
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:45,442
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

538
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:46,735
Pretty good.

539
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:48,654
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

540
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,156
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

541
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:52,241
- Good.
- Yeah.

542
00:42:52,324 --> 00:42:53,283
That's great.

543
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:54,826
Yeah, it's good,
it makes sense.

544
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:56,620
Well done.

545
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,288
When are you going?

546
00:42:58,372 --> 00:43:00,457
I'm going
to go Monday.

547
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,792
Wow, that's, that's soon.

548
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:05,378
You'll get
your girlfriend back,

549
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:07,422
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

550
00:43:07,506 --> 00:43:10,466
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

551
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:11,802
- Good.
- But listen,

552
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:13,470
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

553
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:15,513
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

554
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:17,057
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

555
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:19,559
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

556
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,145
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

557
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:23,522
Like what we
were playing on?

558
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:25,482
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

559
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:26,941
I'd love that.

560
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:28,359
Really? Cool.

561
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:30,779
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

562
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:34,991
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

563
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:36,743
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

564
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,662
All right, guys, welcome.

565
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:43,542
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

566
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,085
That is your
live rooms in there.

567
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,713
This is a new desk.

568
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:50,757
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

569
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:52,258
Now all in all,
we're talking about

570
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:53,343
three grand
for a weekend of...

571
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:54,469
- Three?
- Yeah.

572
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:56,012
Three grand, that's pretty good.

573
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,388
You must be crazy.

574
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:58,598
$3,000.

575
00:43:58,682 --> 00:44:00,976
Well, have a look around.

576
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:03,645
You've everything
you need.

577
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:06,647
- What do you think, is it good?
- It's pretty good.

578
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:09,150
We'll give you one.

579
00:44:10,944 --> 00:44:11,904
I'm sorry.

580
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:13,321
Have you heard
this guy's songs?

581
00:44:13,405 --> 00:44:14,739
I haven't yet, no.

582
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:15,782
He's great.

583
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:16,866
Okay, but, uh,

584
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,952
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

585
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:25,332
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

586
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,045
We can talk about two.

587
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:30,672
We don't talk.

588
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:32,007
We shake.

589
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,258
We shake on two, yeah?

590
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:35,134
Shake now?

591
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:36,345
All right.

592
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:37,345
Two thousand.

593
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:38,513
She drives a hard bargain.

594
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:39,556
She's a tough cookie.

595
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:47,146
So you like this shop?

596
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,483
I buy all my clothes here.

597
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:51,484
It's good for me, you know?

598
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:53,152
Cheap.

599
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:55,238
Nice fashions.

600
00:44:56,406 --> 00:44:57,365
Okay, you ready?

601
00:44:57,449 --> 00:44:59,534
Yeah, I'm ready.

602
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:06,332
That's good. That will do.

603
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,293
Do you like it?

604
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:09,461
You're gorgeous.

605
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:11,212
All right, can we go?

606
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:38,823
The quality is poor,

607
00:45:38,907 --> 00:45:41,993
but if we can get
a professional tape,

608
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:45,997
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

609
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,460
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

610
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:51,794
You play it to your boss.

611
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:53,421
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

612
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:57,092
Can I show you something?

613
00:45:57,175 --> 00:46:01,137
I want to be free

614
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:02,722
I want to be me

615
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:06,183
I want you to be you

616
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,671
Nice one, lads.

617
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:36,714
How's it going?

618
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:37,841
How's it going?
All right.

619
00:46:37,924 --> 00:46:38,883
Good, how is it today?

620
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:39,884
Is it slow?

621
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:41,552
Have a look
there yourself.

622
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:43,637
Is that it? Is that it?

623
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:44,806
That's it, that's it.

624
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,224
That's how it's
going at the moment.

625
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:47,433
Listen, I wanted
to ask you,

626
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:49,060
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

627
00:46:49,144 --> 00:46:50,395
How's it going?
All right?

628
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:52,772
Of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios,

629
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:55,107
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

630
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:57,569
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

631
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,569
A bit of recording?

632
00:46:58,611 --> 00:46:59,570
Bit of recording, yeah?

633
00:46:59,612 --> 00:47:01,072
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff, or...?

634
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:02,781
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

635
00:47:02,866 --> 00:47:03,992
We only do Lizzy.

636
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:06,994
Really. It's one
of our things.

637
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:10,914
That sort of stuff, is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

638
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,417
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

639
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,586
Singer-songwriter stuff?

640
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:15,920
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

641
00:47:16,004 --> 00:47:17,422
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

642
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:18,422
- Uh...
- It's great.

643
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:19,924
Is it?

644
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:20,925
Well, look, like I said,

645
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:22,260
I don't really know
much about them,

646
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:23,428
but they seem
like nice people.

647
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:25,012
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

648
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:26,055
- Then we go.
- Cool.

649
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:27,140
Great, great.

650
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,454
Okay, come on,
we can go.

651
00:47:50,497 --> 00:47:52,123
Cool.

652
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,810
Food's ready! Everybody
get your plates ready!

653
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:22,319
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

654
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:24,613
Come on in, kids!
Take a seat!

655
00:48:39,629 --> 00:48:40,838
Everything all right
here, folks?

656
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,298
Yeah, brilliant.

657
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:43,424
Enjoying the party?

658
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:44,425
Yeah.

659
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:45,467
Great to see you here.

660
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:46,969
Can you sing?

661
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:48,387
If you can't sing,
you're out.

662
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:53,308
There's one request
I'll ask of you

663
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:58,647
When your liberty you gave

664
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:03,444
Remember Mitchell far away

665
00:49:03,528 --> 00:49:08,365
A convict bound in chains.

666
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:19,918
...mine that once held
this heart of mine.

667
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:32,096
And I love her so

668
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:37,393
I wouldn't trade her
for gold

669
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:44,609
I'm walking on moonbeams

670
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:50,239
I was born
with a silver spoon

671
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,622
Hell, I'm gonna be me

672
00:49:56,705 --> 00:50:01,668
I'm gonna be free

673
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:07,882
I'm walking on moonbeams

674
00:50:07,967 --> 00:50:14,055
Staring out to sea

675
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:21,479
And if a door be closed

676
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:26,776
Then a row of homes
start building

677
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:34,660
And tear your curtains down

678
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:41,875
For sunlight is like gold

679
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:44,420
Hell, you better be you

680
00:50:53,221 --> 00:50:54,347
Hey.

681
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,473
What are you doing here?

682
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:59,017
I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

683
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:00,268
That's your bike?

684
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:01,437
It's me dad's.

685
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,147
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

686
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,231
off him for the day.

687
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,524
If he knew,
he'd kill me.

688
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:08,110
Would he?

689
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:10,112
So do you fancy a spin, no?

690
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:13,657
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

691
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:15,701
That's cool.

692
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:16,910
Another time, yeah?

693
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,162
Just thought while I
had it, I'd drive over

694
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,957
and see if you were
into going now.

695
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,419
Could you have me back by lunch?

696
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:27,588
Yeah, totally.

697
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,339
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

698
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:30,340
Fancy it?

699
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:31,425
Great.

700
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:11,965
You're what?

701
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:13,174
You're married.

702
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:14,843
Does it surprise you?

703
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:17,846
Fuck's sake.

704
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,975
Yeah.

705
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:23,435
When?

706
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,771
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

707
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,652
So where is he?

708
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:34,154
He's back in
Czech Republic.

709
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:37,824
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

710
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,536
Man.

711
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:45,874
You all right?

712
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,805
What's the Czech
for "ocean"?

713
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,807
Ott-san.

714
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:04,351
Pretty much the same.

715
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,019
Otsan.

716
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,815
So what are
you gonna do?

717
00:53:12,692 --> 00:53:14,027
I don't know.

718
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:20,450
There's such distance
between me and him.

719
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,453
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

720
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:27,790
It doesn't really work.

721
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,793
I'm fine on my own, you know?

722
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:33,087
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

723
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:43,056
What's the Czech for...
"Do you love him?"

724
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:47,477
Noor-esh-ho?

725
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,145
So...

726
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:50,813
Noor-esh-ho?

727
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,192
Noor-ho-tebbe.

728
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:57,488
What?

729
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:59,114
Come on, let's go.

730
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:00,323
What'd you say?

731
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,159
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

732
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:05,620
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

733
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:06,705
- Yeah.
- No.

734
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,581
So come on, can I have a go?

735
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:09,583
No.

736
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,876
Please.

737
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,962
No, leave it alone, will you?

738
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:16,172
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

739
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:18,174
Come on, just once.

740
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:19,175
No, it's not mine.

741
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,259
Me dad would go
fucking crazy.

742
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:21,302
But he's not here now.

743
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,304
Be careful, will you!

744
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:23,763
Be careful,
for fuck's sake.

745
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:25,098
Look, he's not
here now.

746
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:27,141
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

747
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,185
- No?
- No.

748
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:31,187
- Please?
- No.

749
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:32,730
Me dad will go
bleedin' mental.

750
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:34,273
He totally loves this thing.

751
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,109
Yeah, but you drive it.

752
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:37,652
Yeah, he doesn't
know I have it.

753
00:54:37,735 --> 00:54:38,695
He doesn't?

754
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:39,779
No.

755
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:42,699
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

756
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:46,118
No.
You can't have a go on it.

757
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:47,120
Just once.

758
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:48,121
No.

759
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:51,457
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

760
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,459
No.

761
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:53,710
Come on, give
us the keys.

762
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:55,003
I'll do it myself.

763
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:56,212
The key's in it.

764
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:07,807
Thank you for the ride.

765
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:08,850
I'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

766
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:10,393
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

767
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,394
Okay.

768
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

769
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,621
Trying to pull myself away

770
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:40,006
I'm caught in a pattern
and I can't escape

771
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:49,515
I'm trying
to pull myself away...

772
00:55:55,522 --> 00:56:00,609
Lately, when I get back,
there's this thing I know...

773
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:05,406
Everything comes
to you, way to go

774
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:10,619
Even a heart has
something to learn...

775
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:12,664
Thanks, Dad.

776
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,125
All right, guys,
this is Eamon.

777
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,668
He's going to
take care of you

778
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:18,795
for the weekend.

779
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:20,296
Eamon, this is everyone.

780
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,422
Kit's set up.

781
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:24,300
Piano is waiting for you
in the live room.

782
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:27,053
Tea and coffee in the kitchen
as you came in. Help yourselves.

783
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:28,596
You'll need plenty.

784
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:30,222
And there is a nice
little burrito place

785
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:32,100
around the corner if you
want a snack, all right?

786
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,101
Great.

787
00:56:33,184 --> 00:56:34,435
Okay, Eamon,
leave it to you.

788
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:35,644
Good luck, everyone.

789
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:38,314
Enjoy. And I might pop in
later, all right?

790
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:40,107
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers, thanks.

791
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,234
Okay, guys,
good to meet you.

792
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,653
We've a few little
bits and pieces

793
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:44,695
to set up.

794
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:46,197
I want to check
the drums inside.

795
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,657
We've already set up the kit.

796
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:52,078
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

797
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:54,163
I checked them already; it's fine.

798
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:58,084
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

799
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,877
Oh.

800
00:56:59,961 --> 00:57:01,337
Have you done much recording?

801
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:03,089
- No. -
No. - No.

802
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:05,508
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

803
00:57:33,578 --> 00:57:35,329
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

804
00:57:35,412 --> 00:57:36,663
I'm stuck here in the studio

805
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:38,166
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

806
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,460
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

807
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:44,589
Okay, are you ready to rock?

808
00:57:44,672 --> 00:57:45,548
Are we ready?

809
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:47,049
Yep. We're in tune.

810
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,345
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

811
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:53,472
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

812
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:55,057
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

813
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,101
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

814
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:59,145
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

815
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:01,104
And you know what you're doing.

816
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:06,402
All right, then, so, uh...

817
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:07,903
whenever you're ready, yeah.

818
00:58:15,244 --> 00:58:17,371
All right, later.

819
00:58:17,454 --> 00:58:19,081
Okay, we're ready. Fire one.

820
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:20,917
You sure you're ready?

821
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:24,378
Okay, listen now for
the click track, everybody.

822
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:25,879
And away we go.

823
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:30,759
This is track one,
take one, yeah.

824
00:58:30,843 --> 00:58:33,803
All right, lads, here we go,
this is it, yeah.

825
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:54,950
So

826
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:59,621
If you want something

827
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:03,458
And you call, call

828
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:07,462
Then I'll come running

829
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:10,299
To fight

830
00:59:10,341 --> 00:59:14,052
And I'll be at your door

831
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:23,145
When there's nothing
worth running for

832
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:27,232
When your mind's made up

833
00:59:27,316 --> 00:59:31,320
When your mind's
made up

834
00:59:31,403 --> 00:59:35,156
There's no point
trying to change it

835
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,411
When your mind's made up

836
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:42,956
When your mind's
made up

837
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,377
There's no point
trying to stop it

838
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,880
You see

839
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:54,675
You're just like everyone

840
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,555
When the shit falls

841
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:04,144
All you want to do
is run away

842
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:09,983
And hide all by yourself

843
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:13,737
When you're far from me

844
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,825
There's nothing else

845
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:22,704
When your mind's made up

846
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:26,500
When your mind's
made up

847
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:30,420
There's no point trying
to change it

848
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:34,466
When your mind's made up

849
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,553
When your mind's
made up

850
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:42,348
There's no point
even talking

851
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:46,353
When your mind's made up

852
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:50,357
When your mind's
made up

853
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,235
There's no point
trying to fight it

854
01:00:54,278 --> 01:00:58,573
When your mind's

855
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:06,665
Your mind's

856
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:10,710
Made

857
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:12,838
Up...

858
01:01:21,555 --> 01:01:25,891
Ah

859
01:01:25,976 --> 01:01:29,604
There's no point trying
to change it

860
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:37,654
When your

861
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:46,037
Oh

862
01:01:53,546 --> 01:02:02,512
Ooh, ooh

863
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:11,437
So... if you ever
want something

864
01:02:13,273 --> 01:02:17,527
And you call, call

865
01:02:17,611 --> 01:02:21,823
Then I'll come running.

866
01:02:29,123 --> 01:02:30,916
Okay.

867
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:32,751
Wow.

868
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,335
That was nice.

869
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:37,381
Did you write that?

870
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:38,673
Yeah.

871
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:50,267
You must have
fallen from the sky

872
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:53,271
You must have shattered
in the runway

873
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:25,928
You need somewhere
to fall apart

874
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:33,603
Someone to fall upon

875
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:42,737
That fools the bulls

876
01:03:42,821 --> 01:03:44,781
The powdered hag

877
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:27,406
Okay, what do you think?

878
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,701
I think it's fucking weird.

879
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:33,370
There's a couple of little tech bits,
we can probably fix them,

880
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:36,791
but uh, you know, it's 4:00 in the morning,
so it's up to you guys.

881
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:40,294
Do you want to push through
or go for another one?

882
01:04:40,336 --> 01:04:42,964
I'd love to keep going
if everybody is into it.

883
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,132
Can I have a cup of tea
or something first?

884
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:46,926
Want a cup of tea?

885
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,720
- You want to take ten or 15, yeah?
- Sure.

886
01:04:49,805 --> 01:04:51,223
I'll tweak what I can.

887
01:04:51,306 --> 01:04:52,724
You guys take ten.

888
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:57,436
Guys, why do you think there
are no blonde priests?

889
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,856
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

890
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:22,754
This is great.

891
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:49,614
How's it going?

892
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:53,868
Good.

893
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:56,120
I don't think we're supposed
to be here, though.

894
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:58,664
Ah, it's all right.

895
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:00,208
This is beautiful, isn't it?

896
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,668
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

897
01:06:02,752 --> 01:06:03,837
It's a perfect piano.

898
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,213
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

899
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:09,383
Play us one of your songs.

900
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:13,221
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

901
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:15,264
Go on, I'd love to hear one.

902
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,227
Okay, I have one,

903
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:22,855
but... it's not finished and I...

904
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:24,148
I don't really...

905
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:25,316
Just play it, I know.

906
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,067
Okay, but the lyrics
are very rough, okay?

907
01:06:27,152 --> 01:06:29,821
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

908
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:50,131
Walking up the hill
tonight

909
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:55,595
When you have closed
your eyes

910
01:06:59,017 --> 01:07:03,854
I wish I didn't have
to make

911
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:09,401
All those mistakes
and be wise

912
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:18,243
But please try
to be patient

913
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:24,291
And know
that I'm still learning

914
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:33,508
I'm sorry
that you have to see

915
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:38,471
The strength inside me
burning

916
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:47,815
And where are you,
my angel, now?

917
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:54,655
Don't you see me crying?

918
01:07:56,073 --> 01:08:01,328
I know that you can't
do it all

919
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:07,960
But you can't say
I'm not trying

920
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:15,466
And I'm letting myself down

921
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:22,349
By satisfying you

922
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:30,357
I really wish
that you could see

923
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,401
I...

924
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:48,083
You all right?

925
01:08:49,669 --> 01:08:51,045
Did you write that
for your husband?

926
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,379
Yes, I did,

927
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,922
and he didn't like it.

928
01:08:54,007 --> 01:08:55,591
What an idiot.

929
01:08:55,675 --> 01:08:57,676
Yeah, he's an idiot.

930
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:27,163
Come on away to London with me.

931
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:29,833
Come on, we'll write loads of
songs and live in a nice flat.

932
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,459
You can bring Ivonka over,
it'll be brilliant.

933
01:09:31,544 --> 01:09:32,920
Come on.

934
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:34,630
Yeah, we'll go to London

935
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:36,840
and no one will ever
find us again.

936
01:09:36,924 --> 01:09:38,050
- No one.
- No one.

937
01:09:38,134 --> 01:09:39,468
We'll have a brilliant band.

938
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,595
We'll sell out all the places
and it'll be great.

939
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,430
And we'll make
an album together?

940
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:44,974
I'd love that, come on.

941
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,433
Yeah, and, and I'll do

942
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:47,559
the backing vocals on it?

943
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:48,768
Yeah, and play
the piano.

944
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:50,062
Mm-hmm.

945
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:51,480
Come on, I'm serious.

946
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:53,357
Can I bring my mother?

947
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:02,157
Well, we should go back
to work.

948
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,453
- Yeah.
- Okay.

949
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:27,933
What day is it today?

950
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,478
Monday.

951
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:34,648
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

952
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,650
What's the car
test, Eamon?

953
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,776
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

954
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,320
big studio speakers.

955
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:43,573
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

956
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:44,742
So...

957
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:45,909
All right, let's go.

958
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:48,161
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

959
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:49,454
Great, man.

960
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:50,789
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

961
01:10:50,873 --> 01:10:52,791
Let's go.

962
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:56,461
We'll clear this up later.

963
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:01,966
Timmy!

964
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:03,052
Come on.

965
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:04,887
Beauty.

966
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,812
Beauty.

967
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:16,815
All right.

968
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:31,908
There they are.

969
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,202
Listen, man, fucking...

970
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,619
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

971
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,747
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

972
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,165
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

973
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:40,249
It was great.

974
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,500
Nice, man, thank you.

975
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:43,461
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

976
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:44,504
Right, nice one.

977
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,589
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

978
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,473
So this is it.

979
01:13:55,557 --> 01:13:57,475
- Yeah.
- We did it.

980
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,185
It sounds great.

981
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:00,437
It does, doesn't it?

982
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,604
Could I have one?

983
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,022
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

984
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,441
I've got to
go this way.

985
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,444
Really.

986
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,445
Where you going?

987
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,489
Home.

988
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:14,033
You don't want
to come back?

989
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:15,118
I'll make you breakfast.

990
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,744
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

991
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:20,205
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

992
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:21,457
So do you.

993
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:22,583
Yeah.

994
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,085
You're leaving.

995
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:26,087
To London.

996
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,630
What do you have
to organize?

997
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:28,798
What's, what's that about?

998
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,759
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

999
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,052
He's coming over.

1000
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,929
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play... That's great.

1001
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,680
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

1002
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:38,892
We'll try to
make it work.

1003
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,226
It's for the best.

1004
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,560
Yeah.

1005
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:43,605
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

1006
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,064
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

1007
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,608
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

1008
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:48,777
Listen to the tunes.

1009
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,737
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

1010
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,822
For what?

1011
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,573
What do you mean, what?

1012
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,618
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

1013
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,244
But we done our work.

1014
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,578
Why would I go over?

1015
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,580
We'd just hanky panky
if I come now.

1016
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,084
What?

1017
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,293
Hanky panky?

1018
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:09,589
It won't be for hanky panky.

1019
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,007
I know it would.

1020
01:15:13,635 --> 01:15:16,429
And that would be nice.

1021
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,638
Would it?

1022
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,848
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

1023
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:22,894
Be worthless though.

1024
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:29,191
Come back later.

1025
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:33,237
Mmm.

1026
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,868
Okay, I'll come.

1027
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,244
Yeah?

1028
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:41,495
I'll come later, yeah.

1029
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,955
Brilliant.

1030
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,124
You sure?

1031
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,500
Brilliant.

1032
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,626
All right, then...

1033
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,627
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

1034
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,672
You, too.

1035
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,170
Well, what do you think?

1036
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,301
You like it?

1037
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,720
It's just a demo,
you know...

1038
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:23,180
It's fucking brilliant.

1039
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:24,431
Really?

1040
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,433
Fantastic stuff.

1041
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:29,478
That'll be a hit, no question.

1042
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:32,022
When are you off?

1043
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:34,065
What?

1044
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,777
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

1045
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,321
for a deposit on a place.

1046
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:41,365
Going to come over
and see you

1047
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,117
when you're settled in.

1048
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,038
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

1049
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,666
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

1050
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,668
Good man.

1051
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,420
About time.

1052
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,342
Will you be all right?

1053
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:02,386
What do you mean?

1054
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:07,516
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

1055
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,977
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

1056
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,813
- for a few months.
- Go.

1057
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:14,398
And the best

1058
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,149
of luck, son.

1059
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,777
Thanks, Dad.

1060
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,988
Make your ma proud.

1061
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,118
Now play it again.

1062
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,412
Okay.

1063
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:30,623
That's good.

1064
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,207
Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

1065
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,459
Oh, yeah? What are they like?

1066
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:36,045
They're good.
I'm happy with them.

1067
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,839
Great.

1068
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:40,924
I've missed you.

1069
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,177
Yeah, me, too.

1070
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,762
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

1071
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:47,431
No. I'll come find you.

1072
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,184
I'm glad you've decided to come.

1073
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,149
Listen, I'm going
to get cut off here, all right?

1074
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,401
Money's running out.

1075
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,945
Hurry up.

1076
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,238
How are you?

1077
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,405
Hello, handsome.

1078
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,698
- Ahoy.
- Ahoy.

1079
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:48,284
Um, is-is herself in?

1080
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,493
No, no.

1081
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:50,869
Oh. Great.

1082
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,666
You don't know
where she is, do you?

1083
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,000
Uh, she's-she's working.

1084
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,543
She coming back, uh, evening.

1085
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,919
Oh, okay.

1086
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:02,005
Uh, will you tell her
I'm-I'm going away?

1087
01:20:03,423 --> 01:20:05,425
Uh, will you tell
her I'll call her?

1088
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,386
Uh... Sorry.

1089
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,513
- No telephone here.
- You don't have a telephone?

1090
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,764
No telephone here, no.

1091
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,056
Damn.

1092
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,892
Um, I'll write her, yeah?

1093
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,977
Uh, you write her
a letter? Yeah?

1094
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,396
Yeah, I'll write her
a letter, yeah, yeah.

1095
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,565
You go?

1096
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:20,941
- No.
- Yeah?

1097
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:22,692
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

1098
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:23,943
- Bye.
- See you, Ivonka.

1099
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,362
- Bye.
- Oh.

1100
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,280
- Ciao.
- I'm sorry...

1101
01:20:41,252 --> 01:20:43,212
Flowers?

1102
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,549
Want to buy
the flowers?

1103
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:08,446
- Hey.
- How's it going?

1104
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:12,033
- Um, could I have a word with you about something back here?
- Yeah, sure.

1105
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,112
One, two, three.
