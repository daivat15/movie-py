1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000

2
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,036
Juice by Tappy. Juice by Tappy.

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,245
Juice by Tappy.

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,749
Tappy got juice. Tappy got juice.

5
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,084
Whoa, Tappy.

6
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,129
Juice. Juice. Who wants juice?

7
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,714
Juice.

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,091
Juice by you. Juice by you.

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,135
Juice. Juice by you.

10
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,304
Thank you. Thank you.

11
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,847
Thank you.

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,224
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

13
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,559
I said, we got a winner.

14
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,895
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,104
We got a winner.

16
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,857
Our winner is a flight attendant
from Washington, D.C.

17
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,193
Please welcome Mary Kellington.

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,403
Juice by Mary. Juice by Mary.

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,447
Juice by Mary.

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,992
Harold, please, not again the TV.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,453
Ma. Come on, Ma.

22
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,580
Why you have to make
such a big deal, Ma?

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,958
You know you'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

24
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,838
Why you gotta make me feel
so guilty, Ma?

25
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,764
Jesus. What are you trying to do?

26
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,058
You trying to get me
to break my mother's set?

27
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,309
Or break the radiator?

28
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,977
Maybe blow up the whole house?

29
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,147
Is that what you're trying to do?
Your own flesh and blood, Ma.

30
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,234
Is that what you're trying to do?
Your own son.

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,614
Why you always gotta play games
with my head, for chrissake?

32
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,282
Harold, I wouldn't do that.

33
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,161
But the chain isn't for you.

34
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,830
It's for the robbers.

35
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,125
Then why won't you come out?

36
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,424
See what I mean? You see how you
always gotta upset me, Ma?

37
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,551
For chrissake.

38
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,440
Ma?

39
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,860
Ma.

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,032
Come on out. Please, Ma?

41
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,537
Screw it.

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,873
This isn't happening.

43
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,377
And if it should be happening,
it would be all right.

44
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,921
So don't worry, Seymour.

45
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,049
It'll all work out.

46
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,259
You'll see already.

47
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,219
In the end, it's all nice.

48
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,393
Shit, man.

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,063
That motherfucker starting
to look a little seedy, Jim.

50
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,190
What, are you particular
all of a sudden?

51
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,109
Hey, baby, I don't care
if your motherfucker growing hair...

52
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,736
...as long as we get our bread.

53
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,573
- Just give me a hand, Ty.
- All right, man. We're out of here.

54
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,826
Look at that.

55
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,749
- Hello.
- Hi.

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,417
Whoopie fuck. The table too.

57
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,129
What do you want from me, huh?
You want me to schlep it on my back?

58
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,257
- You got it, friend.
- I ain't my leopard schlepping. Shit.

59
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,009
Such a son, a goner.

60
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,013
Your mother needs you
like a moose needs a hat rack.

61
00:05:55,814 --> 00:06:01,235
What?

62
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,291
Shit, man.

63
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,253
This is some boss skag, baby.

64
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,838
I mean, dynamite.

65
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,590
Oh, man, it's something else.

66
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,182
You know what we need to do?

67
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,394
We need to get us a piece
of this Brody shit...

68
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,688
...cut it up, and off it.

69
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,648
We could double our money easy.

70
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,567
We could buy us a couple of pieces...

71
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,194
...and we got some whole
another shit going on.

72
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,612
That would be righteous.

73
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,740
I bet in no time at all...

74
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,410
...we could get a pound of pure
straight from Sal the Geep.

75
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,206
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
No hassles.

76
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,128
- How's it going, babe?
- What's up, buddy?

77
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,130
- The usual?
- Yeah, it sounds good.

78
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,991
Jesus Christ.

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,589
Anything else?

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,510
No. Nothing. I'm all right.

81
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,522
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Goldfarb.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Rabinowitz.

82
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,774
Although I'm not so sure
how good it is.

83
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,984
- And you?
- What can I say?

84
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,612
- You want your TV?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

85
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:14,618
Mrs. Goldfarb, can I ask you
a question, you won't take it personal?

86
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,164
How many years we know each other?
Who's to count?

87
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,960
Why don't you tell already the police?
Maybe they could talk to Harry?

88
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,878
He wouldn't be stealing
no more the TV.

89
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,631
Mr. Rabinowitz, I couldn't do that.

90
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,717
Harry's my only child.

91
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,719
He's all I have.

92
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,555
Thank you, Mr. Rabinowitz.

93
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,560
Join us in creating excellence. Juice.

94
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,773
You'll have more passion for living
than you ever imagined.

95
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:53,657
Be excited. Be, be excited.

96
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,118
- Yeah.
- Be excited. Be, be excited.

97
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,496
Change your life. Completely turn it
around. They got the juice?

98
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,541
- Yeah. They got the juice.
- Juice it up.

99
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,445
Hello. Who is it?

100
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,215
- Shit.
- Now what?

101
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,478
It will change your life.
You know how my life started out.

102
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,231
I was an overweight man,
living in a one-room apartment.

103
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,525
I didn't have the money
to feed myself anymore.

104
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,820
I had no will to live.
I'd hit my rock bottom.

105
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,988
I stopped right there. In 30 days...

106
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,325
- Hello?
- Mrs. Goldfarb? Mrs. Sara Goldfarb?

107
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,493
Me, speaking.

108
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,496
Mrs. Goldfarb, this is Lyle Russel
from Malin & Block.

109
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,832
- I'm not interested.
- Wait, Mrs. Goldfarb.

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,335
I'm not selling anything. Nothing.
I just want to offer you a chance...

111
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,962
...to be on television.

112
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,839
- You see, Malin & Block...
- Television?

113
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,759
That's right, Mrs. Goldfarb.
Television. Congratulations.

114
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,054
- Look, I don't have any...
- I'm not looking for money.

115
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,932
I'm calling to tell you
you've already won.

116
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,686
Malin & Block discovers contestants
for most of America's television shows.

117
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,022
You've already been chosen
from a long list...

118
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,025
...of potential contestants,
meaning you've already won.

119
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,028
Yes, Mrs. Goldfarb.

120
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,197
I never thought I'd be on television.
I'm just a...

121
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,616
That's right. You, on television.

122
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,703
We'll be sending you all
the necessary information in the mail.

123
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,330
Goodbye, congratulations,
and take care.

124
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,166
Juice my life.

125
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,066
But I don't get it.

126
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,027
Why are you so hard on your folks?

127
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,196
I mean, they give you everything.

128
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,741
They hook you up with an apartment,
with a croaker shrink.

129
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,702
Which is fine, you know. It's great.

130
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:29,915
It's just money is never
what I really wanted from them.

131
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,126
You know?

132
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,294
That's pretty much all I have to give.

133
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,631
Why don't you get away from them?

134
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,633
How am I gonna do that?

135
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,302
I don't know.

136
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,138
What about your clothes?

137
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,891
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

138
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,144
I can't.

139
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,395
Why not?

140
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,606
Then when will I have time
to hang with you?

141
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,162
Well.

142
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,830
So where's the party?

143
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,875
When I tell you,
you're gonna jump out of the window.

144
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,964
This is a tough one.

145
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,804
I got a great diet book.

146
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,975
Hey.

147
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,820
They're coming.

148
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:17,189
Be excited. Be, be excited.

149
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,155
- Thanks for the tip.
- Thanks for the tip.

150
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,782
Thank you.

151
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,583
It was commitment, it was passion,
it was three things.

152
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,087
Three things that I did. Three things
that I found could change my life.

153
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,418
I thought I'd catch a little sun today.

154
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,588
Really? Well, in a box, you'll catch it.

155
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,006
Why don't you just relax...

156
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:27,468
...and think how gorgeous you'll look
with your new red hair, huh?

157
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,847
Today the hair, tomorrow the sun.

158
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,642
Anybody want to waste some time?

159
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,982
Angel says this is the time.
We should do it now.

160
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,485
- Shit, I'm gonna call Brody tomorrow.
- Who's Brody?

161
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,988
That's my sweet connection.
He's got some unbelievable shit.

162
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,198
Shit, righteous.

163
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,742
Look, Marion, we got this idea.

164
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,951
What is it?

165
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,413
If we get a piece of this stuff, we can
cut it up and double our money.

166
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,333
Shit, man, then we get us
a pound of pure and retire.

167
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,001
Now, you know what that means.

168
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,211
Homeboy has it.

169
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,047
We can get off hard knocks,
and be on easy street.

170
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,256
Shit.

171
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,176
What's the catch?

172
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,179
That's a red. I mean, that's a red.

173
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,517
I mean, it's not a red red,
but that's a red. It's a red.

174
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,976
- Red?
- Yeah. It's a red.

175
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,730
- You're telling me that's red?
- Yeah, I'm telling you. It's a red.

176
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,399
Then what's orange?

177
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,860
If this is a red,
I want to know, what's orange?

178
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,076
Well, it could be...

179
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:39,039
...that it's a little orange too.

180
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,002
I need to know something.

181
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,971
I always thought you were
the most beautiful girl I ever seen.

182
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,973
Really?

183
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,313
Ever since I first saw you.

184
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,400
That's nice, Harry.

185
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,242
That makes me feel really good.

186
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,581
You know that other people
have told me that before.

187
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,001
And it was meaningless.

188
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,426
Why?

189
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,888
Because you thought
they were pulling your leg?

190
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:40,434
No, no, not like that.
I mean, I don't know.

191
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,436
I don't know or even care if they were.

192
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,814
It's just, from them, it was...

193
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,777
...just meaningless.

194
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,070
You know?

195
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:56,408
But you say it, and I hear it.

196
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,787
I really hear it.

197
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:10,130
You know, somebody like you could
really make things all right for me.

198
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,132
You think?

199
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,970
What is that?

200
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,890
Remember when I told you
about the store?

201
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,517
Yeah.

202
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,395
Well, I been thinking about it a lot...

203
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,815
...and I put together some numbers...

204
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,651
...and it's not impossible.

205
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:35,197
I mean, you know, you could do it.
You should do it.

206
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,617
I mean, we could do it together.

207
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,418
What do you think?

208
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,192
Stop already.

209
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:58,238
You'll feel better in the red dress
than in a cheese Danish.

210
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,569
Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.

211
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,280
- Number one.
- No red meat.

212
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,450
Think about it. What do they stick
in red meat? I ate red meat.

213
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:48,080
I ate red meat to the point
where I would eat it slab right off raw.

214
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,999
Loved my meat. I turned it around.

215
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,668
You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

216
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,295
No red meat.
No red meat for 30 days.

217
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,048
No red meat. You guys are terrific.

218
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:02,136
Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.

219
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,399
- Ada told us. It's gorgeous.
- Sara.

220
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,402
- We're gonna make it darker tomorrow.
- Why darker?

221
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,655
- To go with my red dress.
- But now it's looking like Madonna.

222
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,948
This is not Madonna.

223
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,285
And neither is this,
but soon I'm going on a diet.

224
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,996
- What diet are you on?
- Eggs and grapefruit.

225
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,999
- Oh, I was on that one. Lots of luck.
- It's not so bad.

226
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,460
- How long you been on it?
- All day.

227
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,672
All day? It's 1 :00. All day.

228
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,300
- I'm thinking thin.
- She's thinking thin.

229
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,678
My Louise,
she lost 50 pounds just like that.

230
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,138
- Like that?
- Like what?

231
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,849
What did you do,
put her in a sweatbox?

232
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,644
No. She went to a doctor,
and he gave her pills.

233
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,106
- You don't want to eat.
- So? What's so good about that?

234
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm sitting here not thinking about
chopped liver and pastrami on rye?

235
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,155
You really shouldn't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

236
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,365
Oh, big deal.

237
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,618
I'll sneak another wedge of grapefruit.

238
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,663
- I'm thinking thin.
- Oh, Sara, the mailman.

239
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,834
Sara Goldfarb? You have
something for Sara Goldfarb?

240
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,296
- I'm expecting something.
- Ms. Goldfarb. Goldfarb.

241
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:22,257
- Sara Goldfarb.
- This is it?

242
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,886
- That's it. It's here.
- Wait, wait. I gotta get my stuff.

243
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,180
- All right.
- Okay, I got the tape.

244
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,808
Your name. What's your name?
Put down your name.

245
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,518
S-A-R-A...

246
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,353
...G-O-L-D...

247
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,689
... F-A-R-B.

248
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,273
Dynamite?

249
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:43,654
Dynamite.

250
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,532
All right, we on our way. All right.

251
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,076
Brody's man said he got
some real fine shit, man.

252
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,578
All right, man.

253
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,247
Should be cool.

254
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,040
Hey, Ty?

255
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,712
- Let's do this right, man.
- Come on, baby. Naturally.

256
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,259
- Come on.
- Hurry, hurry. Let's hurry.

257
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,262
- I wonder when you'll hear.
- Yeah, me too.

258
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,432
- Hi.
- I want to come with you.

259
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,184
You know, maybe they'll send you
to Tavern on the Green.

260
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,270
That's where they send all those stars.

261
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,189
Yeah, I'm eating eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern on the Green.

262
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,399
I hope they have that.

263
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,651
- Hurry before the mailman comes.
- Here we are.

264
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,778
- Oh, God.
- Mail it.

265
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,198
Oh, it's done.

266
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,660
Oh, this is so exciting.

267
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,496
This is so exciting.

268
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,021
There it is, Jim.

269
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:45,859
There it is, baby.

270
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,612
Oh, shit.

271
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,614
Should we try?

272
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,950
Wait, Ty.

273
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,035
Look.

274
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,955
This is our chance to make it big.

275
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,708
We play it right...

276
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,335
...and we can get a pound of pure.

277
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,879
But if we get wasted...

278
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,381
...we'll fuck it up.

279
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,758
Right on.

280
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,219
Hey, look, I ain't trying to jive you, Jim.

281
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,889
I don't want to be running the streets
with my sneakers ripped up...

282
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,225
...and my nose running down
to my chin.

283
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,853
All I'm saying
is we should take a little taste...

284
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,188
...so we know how much to cut.

285
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,565
It's business.

286
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,736
Fair enough.

287
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,078
Shit.

288
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,847
Thank you. Three things is all I did
to change my life.

289
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,099
Thirty days is all it takes.
Three things.

290
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,726
- Number two.
- Number two.

291
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,269
No refined sugar.

292
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,772
Sugar's everywhere in sight.
Sugar's everywhere.

293
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:08,025
You know they even put sugar
in bottled water?

294
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,568
I was sick with sugar.

295
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,695
That was my medicine.
It nurtured me.

296
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,782
It nurtured my spiraling brain
that felt I was a loser.

297
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,742
- Juice by you.
- Juice by you.

298
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,330
- Number two is no refined sugar.
- No refined sugar.

299
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,458
Sodas? Don't even think
about sodas anymore.

300
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,087
No sucking candies. Very good, sir.
None of that stuff. Stay away from it.

301
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,298
Check loaves of bread. Watch your
toothpaste. No refined sugar.

302
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:34,802
I said, "For 30 days,
I'm gonna eat right.

303
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,887
I am gonna pick up my spirits...

304
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,764
...and I am gonna try."

305
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,225
I found hope.

306
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,769
And in that hope,
I found a way of thinking.

307
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,612
Shut up.

308
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,065
- Hello?
- Rosie?

309
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,608
- Yeah?
- Sara.

310
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:32,818
Yeah?

311
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,029
I need the number of that doctor.

312
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,200
I don't understand
why you gotta see him.

313
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,786
Cut the son of a bitch loose,
for chrissake.

314
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,413
Because I don't want him...

315
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,207
... mentioning to my parents
that I've stopped therapy.

316
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,003
They're already so pissed off at me,
they're thinking of cutting me off.

317
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,465
Harry, I'm not gonna sleep with him
or anything.

318
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,676
I'm gonna come home
after the concert.

319
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,763
You're jealous.

320
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,932
Harry's jealous?

321
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,311
Oh, put your arms around me.

322
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,396
- No.
- Oh, you are so stubborn.

323
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,690
Put your arms around me.

324
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,569
Stop that.

325
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,239
I'll suck your eyeballs out.

326
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,742
Well?

327
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,205
I'm disappointed
that you're indisposed.

328
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,833
Is Anita out of town or something?

329
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,753
Why do you ask?

330
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:36,256
I was just wondering
if she was indisposed.

331
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,765
No. She's fine, thank you.

332
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,767
Actually, she's in Florida.

333
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,520
Can I ask something
personal, Arnold?

334
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,854
Of course.

335
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,609
- Well.
- Anything. What?

336
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,278
l... You just have
something over here.

337
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,115
- It's gone?
- A little bit. Little bit lower.

338
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:06,286
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
It's much better. It's... Arnold.

339
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,417
So how are you, Mrs. Goldfarb?

340
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,794
How am l? Enormous.

341
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:17,214
- That's why I'm here.
- Oh, I've seen much worse.

342
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,049
Thank you.

343
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,051
How's your hearing and vision?

344
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,137
I have both.

345
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,765
The doctor will be with you shortly.

346
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,816
I see you're a little overweight.

347
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:39,319
A little? I have 50 pounds
I'm willing to donate.

348
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,405
We can take care of that.

349
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,656
No problem.

350
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,125
We're on our way, baby.

351
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,378
Baby, we're on our way.

352
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:40,839
God, it's great out there.
I mean, everybody is thirsty.

353
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,258
Come to me.

354
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,345
Harry.

355
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,722
I am so glad.

356
00:30:53,478 --> 00:31:07,408
Naturally.

357
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,351
Purple in the morning...

358
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,353
... blue in the afternoon...

359
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,230
...orange in the evening.

360
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,776
There's my three meals,
Mr. Smarty-Pants.

361
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,113
And green at night.

362
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,449
Just like that. One, two, three, four.

363
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,772
Why don't you come back
to bed, baby?

364
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,065
Come on now, Alice.

365
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,275
Got plenty of time for that.

366
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,445
Right now I'm grooving
with these new mirrors I got.

367
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:33,387
I told you, Mom. One day I'd make it.

368
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,472
You don't have to make anything,
my sweet.

369
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,599
You just have to love
your mama, huh?

370
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:44,231
What you doing, baby?

371
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,066
Nothing.

372
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,738
Just thinking about you.

373
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,534
And all the nasty things
I'm about to do to you.

374
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,579
Get over here.

375
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:03,208
Ty, you scare me sometimes.

376
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,711
Oh, now, I don't want to scare you.

377
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,088
Shit, I don't want to scare nobody.

378
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,219
All I want out of life is a little bit
of peace and happiness, that's all.

379
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,847
Right now...

380
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:21,810
... I'm with the finest fox
I ever laid my eyes on.

381
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,440
That's what I'll do.

382
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,734
For my mother, you know?

383
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:32,071
I been thinking about getting
something for her, you know, like...

384
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,947
Like a present or something.

385
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,283
But I didn't know
what I was gonna get.

386
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,118
- Until now.
- And?

387
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,579
I finally asked myself, right?

388
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,872
What's her fix?

389
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,125
Television, right?

390
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,795
I mean, if ever there's a TV junkie,
it's the old lady.

391
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:51,131
I figure I owe her a set anyway
with all the wear and tear it got...

392
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,843
...from being schlepped back and forth
to old Abe's all the time.

393
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,221
You really love her, don't you?

394
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,142
I guess so, you know?

395
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:07,731
Most of the time,
I just want her to be happy.

396
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,983
Let's go get it now.

397
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,238
Well, let's push off first.

398
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:21,120
It's early, Harry.
We shouldn't get going till tonight.

399
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:14,214
Be excited. Be, be excited.

400
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:15,799
Be excited.

401
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,385
You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

402
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:19,720
I am a living testament.

403
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:23,223
Sixty-five pounds thinner. I feel great.

404
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,933
Juice.

405
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,901
- Number three.
- Number three.

406
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,694
Whoa, number three.

407
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:40,532
This drives most people crazy.

408
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:45,412
This is easy so far...

409
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,749
...but give yourself the 30 days.

410
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:53,712
I guarantee you ...

411
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:41,635
I mean, that is thin.

412
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,263
- She doesn't look the same.
- This is a waistline.

413
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,890
I can almost zip the dress.
The red dress?

414
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,810
- I've almost got the zipper up.
- Oh, Sara. The mailman.

415
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,896
When I see it,
I'm gonna wave it all over the place.

416
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,774
- Are you sure you looked?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

417
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,276
What did he say?

418
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:58,986
Don't worry, Sara. It'll come.

419
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,988
- He said it'll come.
- Yeah, don't worry.

420
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:03,282
- Two months for a package.
- Two months?

421
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,577
- It's Harry.
- Oh, look.

422
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,621
- Harry.
- Hey, Ma, easy.

423
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,791
You're gonna crush me,
for chrissakes.

424
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,168
Come inside.

425
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,961
- Hello.
- Hi, Harry.

426
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:19,006
- Hello, Harry.
- We'll have a little visit.

427
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,842
So how are you, Harry?
You're looking so good.

428
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,178
- You want something to eat?
- No, Ma.

429
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:26,764
A little nosh maybe? A piece of cake?

430
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:29,016
I could go out and get something
if you want.

431
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:32,478
I don't have anything in the house,
but Ada would have something.

432
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,022
A cupcake maybe?
You want something to eat?

433
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,025
No, no, Ma. Nothing. Please, sit.

434
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:39,985
You're making me dizzy, for chrissake.

435
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,738
Yeah. You notice anything
about me, huh?

436
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,698
You notice I'm slimmer?

437
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:48,077
- Yeah, I guess you are, Ma.
- Twenty-five pounds I lost.

438
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,329
Twenty-five pounds.
Can you believe it?

439
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,415
- And that's only the beginning.
- Great, Ma. That's really great.

440
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:58,212
I'm really happy for you,
but will you sit? Please.

441
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:05,886
Sorry I haven't been around in a while,
Ma, but I been busy. Real busy.

442
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,889
Oh, yeah? You got a good job?
You're doing real well?

443
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:12,184
- Yeah, real good. Real good.
- What kind of business?

444
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:16,897
Well, I'm sort of a distributor,
like, for a big importer.

445
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,233
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh, I'm so happy for you.

446
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,735
Easy. You're killing me.

447
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:24,571
Jesus, what,
have you been lifting weights?

448
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,032
- I always knew you could do that.
- You were right.

449
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,744
Now maybe you'll meet a nice girl
and have a baby?

450
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,581
Well, I already met one.

451
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,875
Ma. Ma, Ma, Ma,
don't go ape shit, all right?

452
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,253
So who is she?
Who's her parents?

453
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,255
- What do they do?
- You know her. Marion.

454
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:42,589
Marion Silver? Remember?

455
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,800
- Oh, Silver.
- Remember? Yeah.

456
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,761
Of course. Manhattan Beach.

457
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:51,015
He's got a house on the Esplanade.
Garment business.

458
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,225
Yeah. He's real big
in women's undies.

459
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:57,187
Hey, hey, before you go bouncing all
over again, and make me forget, Ma...

460
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:59,023
Just...

461
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,275
What I want to tell you is that...

462
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:02,943
...well, I got you a present.

463
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,196
Oh, Harry, I don't need a present.
Just have a baby.

464
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,574
Will you let me tell you what I got you?

465
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,784
Will you, Ma?

466
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,997
Christ, you are really something else
today, you know that?

467
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:18,292
Look, I know...

468
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:20,919
Well...

469
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,632
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.

470
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,301
I want to make it up.

471
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:31,138
I mean, I know I can't change
anything that's happened...

472
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,474
... but I want you to know that...

473
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,017
That I love you...

474
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,603
...and that I'm sorry.

475
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,898
And I want you to be happy.

476
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,359
So I got you a brand-new TV set.

477
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:47,279
It's gonna be delivered in
a couple of days. It's from Macy's.

478
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,824
Yeah.

479
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,994
Your father would be so happy...

480
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,331
... if he could see what you're doing
for your mother.

481
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,920
See that, Seymour?

482
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,756
You see how good your son is?

483
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:09,968
He knows what it's like for his mother,
living all alone.

484
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:12,096
No one to visit her.

485
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,442
Hey, Ma?

486
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:28,028
- You on uppers?
- What?

487
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:29,279
You're on uppers?

488
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:34,576
- You're on diet pills, ain't you?
- I told you. I'm going to a specialist.

489
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:35,786
That's what I thought.

490
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,038
You making a croaker for speed,
ain't you?

491
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,457
Harry, are you all right?
I'm going to a doctor.

492
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,919
- What does he give you, Ma? Pills?
- Of course he gives me pills.

493
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:45,170
What kind of pills?

494
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:47,381
A purple one, a blue one,
an orange one.

495
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,383
I mean, like, what's in them?

496
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,553
Harry, I'm Sara Goldfarb,
not Albert Einstein.

497
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:53,846
How should I know?

498
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:57,349
Does the stuff make you feel good,
sort of, and give you lots of pep?

499
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:59,685
Well, yeah, a little.

500
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:02,396
A little? I can hear you grinding
your teeth from here.

501
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:03,939
That goes away at night.

502
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,442
- At night?
- Yeah, when I take the green one.

503
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,403
Thirty minutes, I'm asleep.
Poof, just like that.

504
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:11,321
Ma, Ma.

505
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:12,948
You gotta cut that stuff loose.

506
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:15,826
- I'm telling you, it's no good.
- What do you mean, no good?

507
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,411
Twenty-five pounds I've lost.

508
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,664
Big deal. So what? You want
to be a dope fiend, for chrissake?

509
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:23,959
What is with the dope fiend? Am l
foaming at the mouth or something?

510
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,252
He's a nice doctor.

511
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,588
I am telling you,
that croaker's no good.

512
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,256
How come you know so much, huh?

513
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,842
How come you know more
about medicine than a doctor?

514
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,929
Believe me, Ma, I know.

515
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,556
All right?

516
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,768
You'll get strung out, for chrissake.

517
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,854
Come on. I almost fit in my red dress.

518
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:47,149
The one I wore
to your high-school graduation?

519
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,276
The one your father liked so much.

520
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:53,947
Oh, I remember how he looked at me
in that red dress.

521
00:42:55,116 --> 00:42:57,326
Mama, what is the big deal
about the red dress?

522
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,040
I'm gonna wear it...

523
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,000
You don't know.

524
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:08,170
I'm gonna be on television.

525
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,964
I got a call and an application, and...

526
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:13,926
Come on, Ma. Who's pulling your leg?

527
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,594
No, no, no, I'm telling you.

528
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:19,473
I'm gonna be a contestant
on television. I don't know when yet.

529
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,518
They haven't told me when,
but you'll see how proud you are...

530
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,770
...when you see your mother
in a red dress...

531
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,647
...on television in golden shoes.

532
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,982
What is the big deal
about being on television?

533
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,319
Those pills you're taking will kill you
before you ever get on.

534
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,029
Big deal?

535
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:36,281
You drove up in a cab.

536
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:39,326
Did you see who had the best seat?

537
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:42,204
I'm somebody now, Harry.

538
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:44,623
Everybody likes me.

539
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:48,502
Soon, millions of people will see me...

540
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,879
...and they'll all like me.

541
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,215
I'll tell them about you...

542
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,426
...and your father.

543
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:57,761
How good he was to us.

544
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,346
Remember?

545
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:05,686
It's a reason to get up in the morning.

546
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:08,731
It's a reason to lose weight...

547
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,358
...to fit in the red dress.

548
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:15,320
It's a reason to smile.

549
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:19,867
lt makes tomorrow all right.

550
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,663
What have I got, Harry?

551
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:31,128
Why should I even make the bed
or wash the dishes?

552
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:35,382
I do them, but why should l?

553
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,760
I'm alone.

554
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,637
Your father's gone.

555
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:42,890
You're gone.

556
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,727
I got no one to...

557
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:49,396
...care for.

558
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:52,232
What have I got, Harry?

559
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,073
I'm lonely.

560
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,077
I'm old.

561
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:05,829
You got friends, Ma.

562
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:08,499
It's not the same.

563
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,335
They don't need me.

564
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:18,884
I like the way I feel.

565
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:22,930
I like thinking about the red dress...

566
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:27,768
...and the television
and you and your father.

567
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:32,648
Now when I get the sun, I smile.

568
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,489
I'll come and visit, Ma.

569
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:45,452
You know, now that I'm straight,
my business is going good...

570
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,539
... I'll come, me and Marion.
We'll come for dinner.

571
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,624
Yeah, good. You bring her.

572
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,961
I'll make a mushroom soup
and a roast.

573
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,422
That sounds great, Ma.

574
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:58,173
That sounds great.

575
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:00,634
I'll give you a call ahead of time,
all right?

576
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,386
Okay.

577
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,305
I'm glad.

578
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,059
I'm glad you have a nice girl
and your own business.

579
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:11,020
I'm glad.

580
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,819
I gotta go, Ma.

581
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:22,531
I got an appointment in Manhattan
in a little bit, but...

582
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:25,617
- But I'll be back.
- Okay. You've still got your key?

583
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:27,745
Yeah, I got it, Ma.

584
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:31,540
Bye, son.

585
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,872
Brody says you coming up quick, kid.

586
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,167
Thanks, man.

587
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:23,008
He says you're smart, you're loyal,
and you're not a junkie.

588
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:27,554
Brody wants to promote you.

589
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:30,516
He wants to give you more
responsibility. You interested?

590
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,728
Yeah. Yeah. Shit, yeah, man.

591
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,857
Fuck me, I'll kill you.

592
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:42,236
- Brody says, you fuck him, I kill you.
- I got that.

593
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,071
Remember that.

594
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:49,576
Shit, you got a white driver.

595
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:58,502
Fuck.

596
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:02,589
What the fuck.

597
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:13,767
Don't move.

598
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:50,262
I love you, Harry.

599
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:56,143
You make me feel like a person.

600
00:48:57,979 --> 00:49:01,190
Like I'm me.

601
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,568
And I'm beautiful.

602
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:08,739
You are beautiful.

603
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:16,455
You're the most beautiful girl
in the world.

604
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,667
You're my dream.

605
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:29,134
No, Mrs. Goldfarb. I'm absolutely
certain. I've checked again.

606
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:31,845
But maybe you gave me a weaker one
last time.

607
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,639
That isn't possible, Mrs. Goldfarb.

608
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,517
Like I said before,
they're all the same potency.

609
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,062
- But something isn't the same.
- You're becoming adjusted to them.

610
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,857
It's nothing to worry about,
Mrs. Goldfarb, okay?

611
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,377
We got a winner.

612
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,295
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

613
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,048
She's a beautiful woman
with a winning sense of humor...

614
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:11,343
...and a magical smile straight
from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

615
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:15,055
Let's give a juicy welcome
to Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

616
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:16,932
Juice by Sara. Juice by Sara.

617
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,269
Juice by Sara. Whoa, Sara got juice.

618
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:23,897
Sara got juice. Whoa, Sara.

619
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,285
Love. Love, Tyrone C.

620
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:38,746
Get your shit together. You made bail.

621
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,497
How much?

622
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:43,917
They got most of our cash,
and you're up for consorting.

623
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:46,003
Oh, shit, man.

624
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,964
Angel says there's a war
between the Italians and the blacks.

625
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,842
He says Sal the Geep
is keeping his shit down in Florida...

626
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,220
- ... until guys like Brody are knocked off.
- Shit.

627
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:58,182
- No one's got a thing.
- Except Big Tim.

628
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,142
Well, shit, let's go see him.

629
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,560
He ain't selling.

630
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:03,103
He only give it up for pussy.

631
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,939
- What?
- Pussy.

632
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:07,524
He's hooked on the thing, man.

633
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:11,278
I told him I'd give him all he wants.
He said I ain't cute enough for him.

634
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:26,627
Come on, number three.

635
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,588
Most people.

636
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,674
You're gonna like it.

637
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:33,300
This is easy.

638
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,803
In thirty days, it will. I gua...

639
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:51,235
You all right?

640
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:56,657
Yeah. lt was just a bad dream.

641
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:59,535
Want some water?

642
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,976
- Maybe we should dip in now.
- Come on, Marion.

643
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,437
I already told you, all right?

644
00:52:27,897 --> 00:52:29,565
It's all we have.

645
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:32,943
Tyrone is gonna score in the morning,
Harry.

646
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,369
I don't know. It's... It's a bitch out there.

647
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,206
It'll be okay.

648
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,210
It'll be okay, Harry.

649
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,717
Yeah.

650
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,469
I guess so.

651
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:07,519
I love you, Harry.

652
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:49,311
What seems to be the problem?
Your weight's doing fine.

653
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:53,273
The weight's fine. I'm not.

654
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:56,276
The refrigerator.

655
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,487
Is something wrong?

656
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,492
Everything's...

657
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,623
...all mixed up.

658
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:11,792
- Confused.
- That's nothing to worry about.

659
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,252
Just get this filled.

660
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,379
Make an appointment for a week.

661
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:27,141
Well?

662
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,601
Ty ain't found nothing yet.

663
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,439
What are we gonna do?

664
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:35,399
I don't know.

665
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,735
Well, you have to do
something, Harry.

666
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:40,154
It's your fault
that we don't have something.

667
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:41,947
What are you talking about?

668
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,742
You were all hot in the biscuit
to get off last night.

669
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:47,119
- That is such bullshit.
- You didn't have to.

670
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,371
- We could've had something.
- What was I to do?

671
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:52,624
I'm gonna sit around and watch you
push off and not go myself?

672
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:54,793
Just don't put it all on me, okay?

673
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,681
Don't worry, man.

674
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:10,059
We'll fill it up again.

675
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:12,519
You know, things will get better.

676
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:16,106
And then we'll be filling the box
back up, you know?

677
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:25,532
So you want to hear the news?

678
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,534
What news?

679
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:31,038
Well, you got your good news,
you got your bad news.

680
00:55:31,956 --> 00:55:32,998
Shoot.

681
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:36,126
The good news is, a couple of days...

682
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:39,088
...there's gonna be some prime
back on the street.

683
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:41,215
Really?

684
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,717
Who told you that?

685
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:46,887
- Angel.
- Yeah?

686
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,056
Yeah, he said, Sal the Geep
sent word...

687
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,809
...to let a couple of keys
go for the season.

688
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,727
Him being a good Christian
and all...

689
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:56,730
...and he don't mind feeding
during the glorious season.

690
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:59,650
- You believe it?
- Well, I did.

691
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:01,485
Until I heard the bad news.

692
00:56:07,992 --> 00:56:09,076
Yeah?

693
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:10,703
The price is double.

694
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,956
You're gonna have to cop for weight.
At least a half a piece.

695
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:15,416
How much?

696
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:18,711
- Two.
- Two?

697
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:21,588
- That's fucking insane.
- Hey, what the fuck you gonna do?

698
00:56:21,756 --> 00:56:24,425
Man ain't gonna lay no nickel bag
on you, that's for sure.

699
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:26,343
Where are we gonna get two?

700
00:56:27,178 --> 00:56:28,554
You mean Arnold?

701
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:33,142
Well, your parents won't even return
your call.

702
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:35,894
I haven't seen him in months.

703
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,855
So what, he's still calling, ain't he?

704
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,940
I don't know.

705
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:44,236
Look, I don't know what else to do.

706
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,739
Okay, this is our last chance
to get back on track.

707
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:50,784
We won't have to scuffle and make
the freezing scene every day.

708
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:54,788
We need the bread.

709
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:58,125
Getting the money
is not the problem, Harry.

710
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:00,878
Well, what is the problem,
for chrissake?

711
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:03,881
I don't know what I'm gonna have to do
to get it.

712
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,556
Look.

713
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,308
Baby.

714
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:18,771
We'll be back in business in no time.

715
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:21,815
We'll start moving again.

716
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:24,818
We'll start saving.

717
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:30,657
It'll be perfect, just like it was.
I promise, Marion.

718
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:35,579
You'll see.

719
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:46,465
No, I'm just...

720
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:49,885
I've had this flu forever it seems like.

721
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:53,263
Are you depressed?

722
00:57:53,431 --> 00:57:56,475
No. It's nothing like that.
I've been...

723
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,310
I've been really busy.

724
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:01,230
Actually, I've been designing nonstop.

725
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:02,940
That's wonderful.

726
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,942
Glad to hear you've been productive.

727
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,949
To be perfectly frank...

728
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,410
... I was a little surprised
to hear from you.

729
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:19,707
Is there something wrong?

730
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:22,042
No. Why?

731
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,837
Well, it's usually the case...

732
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:28,298
...when you get a call from someone
you haven't heard from for a while.

733
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:30,092
Everything's fine.

734
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,848
Actually.

735
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:41,895
I have a favor to ask.

736
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:51,030
You smug fuck.

737
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:52,740
What is it?

738
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:02,166
- I need to borrow some money.
- May I ask what for?

739
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:05,377
Can you turn the light off?

740
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:07,963
What do you want the light off for?

741
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:10,215
I just do.

742
00:59:10,925 --> 00:59:13,594
- You never did before.
- Please, Arnold.

743
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:42,873
For that special someone in your life.
I had these, which I got for my wife...

744
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,293
...and she loves it. And all her friends
are always wanting to see it.

745
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:50,255
And you know, when they hold it,
they're amazed at how heavy it is.

746
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,633
It's really got some nice...

747
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,727
What you've always wanted.

748
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:06,855
A genuine, hand-crafted
Sapphire and diamond ring.

749
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:09,983
And you're gonna really
love the original.

750
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,319
You'll want to buy one
for all of your friends.

751
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,822
The holidays are coming
right around the corner.

752
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:18,200
You need to make some decisions
soon before they're all gone.

753
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:20,619
Sapphire is my wife's birthstone.

754
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:46,515
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, man.

755
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,019
All Angel said was
meet at Walbaron's.

756
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:56,316
- You sure this is the right Walbaron's?
- Yeah, man. I'm positive. All right?

757
01:02:57,068 --> 01:02:58,819
Look, will you just watch my back?

758
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:01,280
And I'll watch yours, all right?

759
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,285
What the fuck are we supposed
to do now?

760
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:07,828
Hey.

761
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:23,677
- Everyone and their mother.
- The truck's gonna be here soon.

762
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:26,180
Yeah, the truck's gonna be here.
Back up.

763
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:30,351
Back up.

764
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:31,578
You ain't gotta be putting up a front.

765
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:34,498
Gun! Gun!

766
01:04:58,606 --> 01:05:00,524
Stupid fucking junkie, man.
We're fucked.

767
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:03,402
- Them motherfuckers is going back.
- That was the last shit.

768
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,280
Sitting their ass in that sun
while we sit here ass deep...

769
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,407
... in some motherfucking snow.

770
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:11,326
Hey.

771
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:14,121
What would happen
if we went down there to cop?

772
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:16,874
- Are you serious?
- Why not?

773
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,667
What the fuck are you saying?

774
01:05:18,835 --> 01:05:22,546
We supposed to walk up to some clerk
at a hotel and ask him for a connection?

775
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:26,967
Get with it. You telling me that you can't
nose out some dope when it's around?

776
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:30,304
Man, we got nothing to lose.

777
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:32,723
It's wide open,
and if we get there right away...

778
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,309
...we can name our own price,
and we can sit back...

779
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:38,645
...and have those fucking fools
scuffle the streets for us.

780
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:41,398
Yeah, man.

781
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:44,943
Last summer was
a motherfucking ball, huh, Jim?

782
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:46,653
Yeah.

783
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:52,993
lt just seems like a thousand years
ago since last summer, man.

784
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:55,162
It'll be like that again, man.

785
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,835
I can get Angel to get us a short...

786
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:04,505
... if we promise him
some dynamite skag.

787
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,041
Baby.

788
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,626
Where have you been?

789
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:27,880
- Where the hell you think I been?
- Waiting all day for you.

790
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,214
Where's the score?

791
01:07:29,382 --> 01:07:31,216
Well, we had a little bit of a problem.

792
01:07:31,384 --> 01:07:34,303
You see,
I mean, everything was going good...

793
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:36,096
...and then some dumb-ass junkie...

794
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:37,765
Did what?

795
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:39,767
Some dumb-ass junkie did what?

796
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:41,226
You mean, you fucked it up?

797
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:43,062
What the fuck is wrong with you?

798
01:07:43,229 --> 01:07:45,606
You promised me that everything
was gonna be okay.

799
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:49,610
I fucked that sleazebag for you, and l
put myself through fucking hell for you.

800
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:52,112
- There's nothing out there.
- I don't give a shit.

801
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,907
You fucking loser.

802
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,536
You want to be sure
we have some extra stuff?

803
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:02,456
Ty told me about a guy
who's holding some weight.

804
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:04,750
But he ain't selling it.

805
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:08,212
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Ty. Give me that guy's number.

806
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,464
- What guy?
- The guy who likes broads.

807
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:11,715
Big Tim? For what?

808
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:14,093
- Just give me the fucking number.
- All right.

809
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,971
934-8777.

810
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,018
You worry so goddamn much, here,
go fix yourself up with him.

811
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:25,062
You won't have to
fucking wait around...

812
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:28,649
...and I won't have to freeze my ass off
in the fucking streets.

813
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:30,150
Fuck you.

814
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,396
- All right. We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

815
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,523
- Oh, we got a winner.
- We got a winner.

816
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:12,192
- We got a winner.
- We got a winner.

817
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,903
She's a beautiful woman
with a winning sense of humor...

818
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:17,823
...and a magical smile.
She's really gonna win your heart.

819
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:20,159
Straight from Brighton Beach,
Brooklyn ...

820
01:09:20,326 --> 01:09:25,205
...please give a juicy welcome
to our very own Mrs. Sara Goldfarb.

821
01:09:25,373 --> 01:09:27,124
Juice by Sara. Juice by Sara.

822
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:29,877
Juice by Sara. Whoa, Sara.

823
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:34,340
Whoa, Sara.

824
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:38,510
- It's a pleasure to be here.
- It's a pleasure to have you.

825
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:41,513
And that is one smashing dress
you have on.

826
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:48,187
Okay, Tappy, if you don't mind,
I would just like to say hello...

827
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:50,064
...to my husband Seymour...

828
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:53,233
...and to my beautiful, successful son,
Harry.

829
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,696
I hope you're in love.

830
01:09:57,864 --> 01:09:59,114
Please come and see me.

831
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:01,533
And bring Marion, won't you?

832
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:03,744
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

833
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:07,664
It's almost that time. Are you ready?

834
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:09,708
I'm ready, Tappy.

835
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,505
Not to worry. Not to worry.

836
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:20,010
- Thirty days to revolutionize your life.
- What are you doing there?

837
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:23,347
- Why are you here?
- Join us in creating the excitement.

838
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,598
What do you want?

839
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:28,102
- Oh, Tappy.
- Juice. Join us in creating excellent...

840
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:32,272
I thought you'd never ask.

841
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,816
Oh, my God.

842
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:37,903
Look at this.

843
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:40,614
It's disgusting.

844
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:42,282
Well, what do you expect?

845
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,369
Could you do any better?

846
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:48,789
- Look at this. It's cracking.
- It's an old building.

847
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,333
lt hasn't been painted in years.

848
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:54,128
I'm old. Alone.

849
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:56,380
You don't understand.

850
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:58,799
Please. I'll explain.

851
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:42,593
What is it? What is it?
No, I don't want that.

852
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,637
What are you doing?
Get away from me.

853
01:11:45,805 --> 01:11:47,806
- Ready, Mrs. Goldfarb.
- Ready for what?

854
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:49,933
Three, two...

855
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,187
What? What am I supposed to do?

856
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:55,856
I don't know what to...

857
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:43,237
Feed me, Sara.

858
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:45,030
Feed me Sara.

859
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:46,490
- Feed me, Sara.
- Feed me.

860
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:47,741
Feed me, Sara.

861
01:12:47,909 --> 01:13:05,676
Feed me, Sara. Feed me, Sara.

862
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:45,632
Thank you, Angel.

863
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:50,262
I sure hope this motherfucker works,
man.

864
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,724
My ass could use some heat. How
long you think this trip gonna take?

865
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:56,018
We'll make it in a day, no problem.

866
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:57,311
- A day?
- Yeah.

867
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:00,314
Shit. California, here we come.

868
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:02,483
It's Florida, Ty. Florida.

869
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,735
Shit, man. California, Florida.

870
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:07,738
Either way,
your pale ass getting a tan, man.

871
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,827
Do you know if this train goes
to Madison Avenue?

872
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:16,455
Do you know Malin & Block?

873
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:19,667
I have their address.
It's on Madison Avenue.

874
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:23,587
- I'm gonna be on television.
- You're a wack.

875
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,924
Hey, hey.

876
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:30,511
Hello? Do you know if this train
Goes to Madison Avenue?

877
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,348
I'm gonna be on television.

878
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:39,520
I just have to find out when.

879
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,564
Florida.

880
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,861
Oh, when is he gonna be back?

881
01:14:49,197 --> 01:14:50,698
A few days.

882
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:53,701
Angel, what am I supposed to do?

883
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:56,787
Angel, you gotta help me.

884
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,124
Oh, come on. I can get you money.

885
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:04,628
Angel, there's gotta be something.
Anything. Help me.

886
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:07,423
Why aren't you calling me?

887
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:11,010
I have to know when I'm gonna be
on television.

888
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:14,847
I'm Sara Goldfarb.

889
01:15:16,307 --> 01:15:19,560
And you should tell me
when I'm gonna be on television.

890
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:21,812
Just sit for a moment. I'll ring them.

891
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:26,066
I just wanna know when.
Maybe you lost my card.

892
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:29,695
Please, darling. You'll have a look,
and you'll tell me.

893
01:15:30,905 --> 01:15:32,239
It's not the prizes.

894
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:33,699
I'll give them away.

895
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:36,785
I just want to be on the show.

896
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:39,371
I've waited so long...

897
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:41,957
...to be on with my Harry...

898
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,418
...and my grandson.

899
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:46,837
Here, Mrs. Goldfarb. Sip this.

900
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:51,800
Sometimes it takes a while
to get called for a show, Mrs. Goldfarb.

901
01:15:56,973 --> 01:15:58,766
- Is this her?
- Yes.

902
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:02,853
- Can you walk?
- I'm walking across the stage.

903
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:06,607
And you should see my Harry
on television.

904
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:09,568
We're giving the prizes away.

905
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:13,280
I just wanted to be on the show.

906
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:18,327
- What's her name?
- We think it's Sara Goldfarb.

907
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:19,536
Call Seymour.

908
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,122
And tell him to meet me
at the beauty parlor.

909
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,958
I got the red dress that I wore
to Harry's graduation...

910
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:26,293
...and the gold shoes.

911
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:29,046
Okay, Mrs. Goldfarb. Here we go.

912
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:32,299
One, two, three.

913
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:34,802
Let's take it nice and easy.

914
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:25,019
Yeah?

915
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,188
Hi.

916
01:17:32,652 --> 01:17:37,239
Harold, I'm going to be on television.

917
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,185
Oh, shit.

918
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,520
Goddamn, Jimmy.
How long you had that?

919
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,315
Just a few days.

920
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:13,233
That shit don't look too good.

921
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:15,694
Yeah, it don't feel
too good either, man.

922
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,532
But a little stuff will take care of that.

923
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,077
Hey, hey, What's wrong with you?
Don't shoot in there.

924
01:18:23,244 --> 01:18:24,995
I'll blow it if I don't.

925
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:27,373
Fuck it.

926
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:41,345
Shit.

927
01:18:55,443 --> 01:18:58,278
- He's gonna be surprised.
- Hi, how are you? Can you hear me?

928
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:01,031
- Yeah, Seymour.
- Did you take anything?

929
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,575
I took my red dress, and...

930
01:19:03,743 --> 01:19:06,537
- No emergency. Take her to Psych.
- Television.

931
01:19:17,298 --> 01:19:18,966
Come on in.

932
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:23,721
Thanks.

933
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,644
What's your name?

934
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,398
Marion.

935
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:36,358
Well, what do you know.

936
01:19:36,526 --> 01:19:38,485
Maid Marion.

937
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,201
I'm Little John.

938
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:53,125
- You have a beautiful view.
- Know what I like about paddy chicks?

939
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:56,920
They give good head.

940
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:00,841
Now, black broads don't know nothing
about no head.

941
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,509
I don't know why.

942
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:06,430
Maybe it has something to do
with some ancient tribal customs.

943
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:12,686
Come here.

944
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:30,037
Better save some of that energy.

945
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,167
Come on.

946
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:49,223
Oh, I know it's pretty, baby.

947
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,225
But I didn't take it out for air.

948
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:02,903
Yeah.

949
01:21:08,576 --> 01:21:12,788
I told your ass,
stay away from that arm. See?

950
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:15,833
I gotta call Marion, man.

951
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:19,169
That's about
to be a long distance call now.

952
01:21:19,337 --> 01:21:21,005
That's 600 miles.

953
01:21:21,172 --> 01:21:24,049
Man, we are 600 miles
closer to Miami.

954
01:21:24,217 --> 01:21:26,844
Yeah, it's also 600 miles further away
from New York, Ty.

955
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,561
I know where you can pick up
a real nice taste.

956
01:21:36,062 --> 01:21:38,522
Though it's more like play.
Sunday night?

957
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,275
We're throwing a little gathering.
All good people.

958
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:44,403
No. I can't. I'm busy.

959
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:46,739
Anyway, I'm not really hooked.

960
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,282
Oh, I know.

961
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,034
But it's a real nice taste.

962
01:21:56,374 --> 01:21:58,667
I'll see you Sunday, Maid Marion.

963
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:03,047
Mrs. Goldfarb. Just try
and answer my questions, okay?

964
01:22:03,214 --> 01:22:05,716
When did you start taking the pills?

965
01:22:06,634 --> 01:22:08,469
- The summer.
- You started in the summer.

966
01:22:08,636 --> 01:22:12,181
- Last summer?
- I got the best place in the sun.

967
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:14,141
- Okay.
- Ada fixed my hair.

968
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:18,604
Everything is gonna be all right.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

969
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:43,170
- Hold tight, man. Hold tight.
- I can't cut it, man. I can't cut it.

970
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:45,255
I gotta do something
about this arm, Ty.

971
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:48,175
All right.
Let me see what it looks like, man.

972
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:56,684
Oh, damn, Jim.

973
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,479
- Oh, man.
- That's the ugliest motherfucker...

974
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:02,022
... I ever seen.

975
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,442
- I gotta call Marion.
- Fuck that.

976
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,444
We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

977
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,201
What is that?

978
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:17,871
I don't want that. I don't want that.

979
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,515
God.

980
01:23:57,078 --> 01:23:58,412
What's the problem?

981
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,248
It's my arm. My arm is killing me.

982
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,583
Let's have a look at it.

983
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,256
All right.

984
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,511
I'll be back in a minute.

985
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:44,333
I want to just play Blackjack all night
long. So I make up this routine.

986
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:46,585
I tell them,
"You guys go. I don't feel good.

987
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,379
You guys go and have a good time."

988
01:24:48,546 --> 01:24:50,422
Sure enough, they leave the room.

989
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,883
- Ready. One, two, three.
- Two, three.

990
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,762
And then, as soon as they leave...

991
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:00,265
... I go running back down to the casino,
sit at my Blackjack table, man.

992
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:02,059
I am there for the whole night.

993
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:04,937
Finally, I get up so big...

994
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:08,148
... I've got $500 black chips
in my pocket.

995
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:09,316
I swear to God.

996
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:13,404
The hours are going by, I'm laying
back, I'm hitting on hard 17s.

997
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:15,114
lt was beautiful.

998
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:18,283
Next thing I know,
this guy is sitting next to me.

999
01:25:18,451 --> 01:25:21,161
He's a security guard.
He's telling me I have to leave...

1000
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:25,666
...like it's a nice conversation. I'm like,
"Why are you telling me to leave?"

1001
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:29,461
He says, "You have to because you've
been betting with the man next to you."

1002
01:25:29,629 --> 01:25:32,548
- And then...
- Swallow.

1003
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:35,175
Swallow.

1004
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:37,678
The guy is forcing me out of the room.

1005
01:25:39,347 --> 01:25:41,974
Swallow.

1006
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:51,734
Rob Smart to Kid Care.

1007
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:54,820
Rob Smart to Kid Care, please.

1008
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:13,422
You have to eat, Mrs. Goldfarb.

1009
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:16,133
If we're gonna get you healthy,
you have to eat. Okay?

1010
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:19,887
Work with the attendants. I'm gonna try
new medications. They should help.

1011
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:23,575
Hello?

1012
01:27:23,743 --> 01:27:25,452
Marion?

1013
01:27:26,204 --> 01:27:27,788
Harry?

1014
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:33,002
Marion, I've been thinking about you
so much.

1015
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,546
Are you okay?

1016
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,883
When are you coming home?

1017
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:41,802
Soon.

1018
01:27:42,303 --> 01:27:43,387
When?

1019
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:46,306
Soon.

1020
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:50,728
- You're holding out, right?
- Harry?

1021
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,482
Can you come today?

1022
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:01,864
Yeah.

1023
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,830
Yeah. I'll come.

1024
01:28:11,332 --> 01:28:13,292
I'll come today.

1025
01:28:18,548 --> 01:28:21,175
You just wait for me, all right?

1026
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:28,098
- Okay, Harry.
- I'm coming back, Marion.

1027
01:28:28,266 --> 01:28:29,767
- Yeah.
- Marion?

1028
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:31,018
Yeah?

1029
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:34,855
I'm really sorry, Marion.

1030
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,940
I know.

1031
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:48,035
Mrs. Goldfarb?

1032
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:51,622
You all right?

1033
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,962
So, Mrs. Goldfarb,
we've tried several medications...

1034
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:01,048
...and you don't seem
to be responding.

1035
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:02,883
I believe we might be at a point...

1036
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,552
...where we might want to try
some alternative methods.

1037
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:10,391
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

1038
01:29:10,558 --> 01:29:14,645
So if I can just get
your John Hancock...

1039
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:18,023
...we'll get underway.

1040
01:29:18,191 --> 01:29:19,233
Great. Thanks.

1041
01:29:20,652 --> 01:29:23,654
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Somebody help us.

1042
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:27,908
- I need a doctor, man.
- My friend is sick.

1043
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:31,161
- I need some help, please. Help us.
- I can't take it, man. My arm.

1044
01:29:31,329 --> 01:29:34,373
- My fucking arm.
- Just hang in fucking tight.

1045
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:37,751
- Oh, man!
- Help us!

1046
01:29:37,919 --> 01:29:40,879
Somebody fucking help us, please!

1047
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:02,443
Maid Marion.

1048
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,403
Welcome.

1049
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:06,780
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1050
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:08,282
Okay for work.

1051
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,909
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:30:11,077 --> 01:30:12,119
Okay for work.

1053
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:15,247
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1054
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:16,582
Okay for work.

1055
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:19,752
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1056
01:30:19,919 --> 01:30:23,213
Okay for work. Can you hear me?
Can you see me?

1057
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:25,132
- Yes, sir.
- Okay for work.

1058
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:28,135
- Fellows, meet Marion.
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?

1059
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:29,678
Okay for work.

1060
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:32,514
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:34,141
Okay for work.

1062
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:36,810
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes, sir.

1063
01:30:36,978 --> 01:30:38,437
Okay for work.

1064
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:40,606
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Showtime.

1065
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:42,691
Okay for work.

1066
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:45,652
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?
- Yes.

1067
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:49,990
Say sir. Goddamn New York,
dope-fiend niggers.

1068
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:52,326
Learn some manners.

1069
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:55,287
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

1070
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,790
- Yes, sir.
- Okay for work.

1071
01:30:57,957 --> 01:31:01,085
- Mouthpiece.
- Can you hear me? Can you see me?

1072
01:31:01,252 --> 01:31:03,295
Says he's got something wrong
with his arm.

1073
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:07,841
I don't think he'll be putting dope
in that arm.

1074
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:09,510
Smells worse than he do.

1075
01:31:09,678 --> 01:31:10,719
Test.

1076
01:31:10,887 --> 01:31:13,847
Get him to the hospital.
I don't expect he'll live out the week.

1077
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:18,143
Ready, and one.

1078
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:43,419
That's the trouble
with you New York dope fiends.

1079
01:31:43,586 --> 01:31:45,879
You got a rotten attitude,
you know that, man?

1080
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:50,092
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Ass to ass.

1081
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:53,971
Ass to ass.

1082
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:04,815
Put your spineless back into it.

1083
01:32:04,983 --> 01:32:06,400
Come on.

1084
01:32:08,528 --> 01:32:12,072
Ready, and two.

1085
01:32:15,326 --> 01:32:17,745
Ass to ass.

1086
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,833
Put it in there.

1087
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:24,418
That's it.

1088
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:27,546
- Nice and easy.
- Keep it in.

1089
01:32:27,964 --> 01:32:29,923
That's the way.

1090
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:33,594
Lose the clothes. I need one gram.

1091
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:37,598
Don't give up. Don't give up.

1092
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:39,516
Move it. Move it. Move it.

1093
01:32:40,643 --> 01:32:45,773
Okay. Ready, and three.

1094
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:54,990
Come, come, come.

1095
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:58,202
We're gonna take it off at the shoulder.
Let's move it, people.

1096
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,412
Come, come, come.

1097
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:51,338
Marion!

1098
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:53,340
Marion?

1099
01:33:53,508 --> 01:33:54,591
It's all right.

1100
01:33:54,759 --> 01:33:57,177
Don't worry. You're in a hospital.

1101
01:33:57,345 --> 01:33:59,346
- Marion?
- Who's that?

1102
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:01,682
She'll be sent for. She'll come.

1103
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:05,352
No.

1104
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:07,187
No?

1105
01:34:09,315 --> 01:34:11,025
No, she won't.

1106
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:13,235
She'll come.

1107
